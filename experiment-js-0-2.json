			"To calculate the median of an array, we need to first sort the array in ascending order. Then, we can determine the middle value or values of the array. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nHere's the code to implement this logic:\n\n```\nfunction median(l) {\n  // Sort the array in ascending order\n  l.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a - b;\n  });\n\n  // Determine the middle index or indices of the array\n  var middleIndex = Math.floor(l.length / 2);\n  var isEvenLength = l.length % 2 === 0;\n\n  // Calculate the median based on the length of the array\n  if (isEvenLength) {\n    // For an even-length array, average the two middle values\n    return (l[middleIndex - 1] + l[middleIndex]) / 2;\n  } else {\n    // For an odd-length array, return the middle value\n    return l[middleIndex];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo use the function, simply pass in an array as the argument:\n\n```\nconsole.log(median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])); // Output: 3\nconsole.log(median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])); // Output: 15.0\n```",

For multiplication, the function multiplies the operand with the current result. For floor division, the function uses the `Math.floor` method to divide the current result by the operand and round down to the nearest integer.

To achieve this, we can first create an expression by iterating through the operand array and inserting the corresponding operator at the required position. Then, we can use the built-in eval() function to evaluate the expression and return the result. Here's the code:\n\n```\nfunction do_algebra(operator, operand) {\n  let expression = operand[0];\n  for (let i = 0; i < operator.length; i++) {\n    expression += operator[i] + operand[i+1];\n  }\n  return eval(expression);\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first initialize the expression variable with the first operand. Then, we use a for loop to iterate through the operator array and insert the operator and the corresponding operand at the required position. Finally, we use eval() function to evaluate the expression and return the result.\n\nNote: The use of eval() function is generally discouraged due to security concerns. In production code, it's recommended to use a safer way to evaluate the expression.",

If it's less than 2, it raises a `ValueError` with a message \"Operand array should have at least two operands.\"\n- Then, it checks whether the length of the `operator` array is equal to the length of the `operand` array minus one or not. If it's not equal, it raises a `ValueError` with a message \"Length of operator array should be equal to the length of operand array minus one.\"\n- Next, it creates an empty string `expression` which will be used to build the algebraic expression.\n- It loops through the `operand` array from the first element to the second last element.

			"The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string `txt` as input and returns a boolean value `true` or `false`.\n\nFirst, the function trims any whitespace at the end of the string using the `trim()` method.

We check if the last character is an alphabetical character by testing it against a regular expression (`/[a-zA-Z]/`). \n\nFinally, we check if the last character is not part of a larger word by testing the last word (with the last character removed) against the same regular expression. We do this using the `slice()` method to remove the last character from the last word, and testing it against the regular expression using the `test()` method.\n\nIf both tests pass, we return `true`, indicating that the last character is an alphabetical character that is not part of a word.

If we go through the entire loop without finding any divisor for n, then n is prime and we can return true.\n\nHere is the function that implements this logic:\n\n```\nfunction is_prime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) { // 1 is not a prime number\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 2; i <= n/2; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n- First, we check if n is less than or equal to 1.

The function then performs a bitwise XOR operation on these two inputs and returns the result as a string.\n\nTo perform the XOR operation, we iterate through both input strings and compare the corresponding bits at each index. If the bits are different (i.e. one is 0 and the other is 1), we add a '1' to the output string. If the bits are the same (i.e. both 0 or both 1), we add a '0' to the output string.\n\nHere's the implementation of the string_xor function in JavaScript:\n\n```\nfunction string_xor(a, b) {\n  let result = '';\n  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n    if (a[i] !== b[i]) {\n      result += '1';\n    } else {\n      result += '0';\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, calling `string_xor(\"010\", \"110\")` would return \"100\", since:\n\n- The first bit of a is 0 and the first bit of b is 1, so we add a '1' to the output string.\n- The second bit of a is 1 and the second bit of b is 1, so we add a '0' to the output string.\n- The third bit of a is 0 and the third bit of b is 0, so we add a '0' to the output string.\n\nTherefore, the resulting output string is \"100\".",
			"The function `string_xor()` takes two input parameters `a` and `b`, which are strings consisting only of 1s and 0s. The function performs a binary XOR operation on these inputs and returns the result also as a string.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `string_xor()` function:\n\n```\nfunction string_xor(a, b) {\n  let result = \"\";\n  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n    if (a[i] !== b[i]) {\n      result += \"1\";\n    } else {\n      result += \"0\";\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nThe function first initializes an empty string `result`. It then loops through each character of the input strings using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if the corresponding characters in both input strings are different using an `if` statement. If they are different, it appends a \"1\" to the result string. Otherwise, it appends a \"0\" to the result string.\n\nOnce the loop is finished, the function returns the result string.\n\nFor example, if we call `string_xor(\"010\", \"110\")`, the function will return \"100\" as the binary XOR of \"010\" and \"110\" is \"100\"."
