Here's the implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # Since the cars are moving at the same speed, collision will only happen\n    # when the distance between the two cars equals the number of cars minus one\n    # For example, if there are 3 cars moving in each direction, the first two cars\n    # from each direction will not collide, but the third car from each direction will\n    # collide with the car coming from the other direction.\n    # Therefore, the total number of collisions will be (n-1) * n.\n    return (n-1) * n\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the fact that the distance between the two cars that collide will be equal to the number of cars minus one. Therefore, we can compute the total number of collisions by multiplying the number of collisions for each car in one direction by the number of cars in the other direction.",
			"Sure, here's the function you requested:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n * (n-1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions that will occur between `n` cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long road. The formula used to calculate this is `n*(n-1)//2`, which is the number of combinations of 2 cars that can collide out of `n` cars.",
			"Here's the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # Each car moving in one direction will eventually meet a car moving in the opposite direction.\n    # Therefore, each of the n cars moving in one direction will have n cars moving in the opposite direction to check for collisions.\n    # The number of collisions for each car moving in one direction is n (since it has n cars moving in the opposite direction to check for collisions).\n    # Therefore, the total number of collisions is the product of n (the number of cars moving in one direction) and n (the number of cars moving in the opposite direction).\n    return n * n\n```\n\nThis function calculates the total number of collisions that will occur given a certain number of cars moving in each direction on an infinitely long, straight road.
