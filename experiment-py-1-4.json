			"Here's the complete function definition for `string_xor` function:\n\n```python\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.\n    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.\n    >>> string_xor('010', '110')\n    '100'\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the strings to integers with base 2\n    int_a = int(a, 2)\n    int_b = int(b, 2)\n    \n    # Perform the XOR operation on integers\n    xor_result = int_a ^ int_b\n    \n    # Convert the XOR result back to binary string\n    xor_string = bin(xor_result)[2:]\n    \n    # Pad the string with leading zeros if necessary\n    padding_length = len(a) - len(xor_string)\n    if padding_length > 0:\n        xor_string = '0' * padding_length + xor_string\n    \n    return xor_string\n``` \n\nThis function takes two binary strings `a` and `b` as input and performs a binary XOR operation on them. The result is then returned as a binary string. The function works by first converting the input strings to integers with base 2, then performing XOR operation on these integers. The resulting integer is then converted back to a binary string and returned. The binary string is padded with leading zeros if necessary to match the length of the input strings."
