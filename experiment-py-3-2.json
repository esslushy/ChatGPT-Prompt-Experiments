			"Here's one possible solution using a brute force approach:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # initialize counter for collisions\n    collisions = 0\n    \n    # simulate cars moving towards each other\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:  # to avoid counting self-collisions\n                if (i < j and i + n > j) or (i > j and j + n > i):\n                    # check if cars collide\n                    collisions += 1\n    \n    return collisions\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of cars.\n- We check if the cars are moving towards each other by checking if their positions overlap at any point.\n- If so, we increment the collision counter.\n- Finally, we return the collision count.\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which may not be efficient for large values of n. There may be more optimized solutions that take advantage of the problem's symmetry or use other algorithms.",
			"One solution to complete the function could be as follows:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # total distance between the two sets of cars\n    total_distance = 2 * n\n    \n    # calculate the time it takes for the two sets of cars to meet\n    time_to_meet = total_distance // 2\n    \n    # calculate the number of collisions\n    num_collisions = n * time_to_meet\n    \n    return num_collisions\n```\n\nThe idea behind the solution is that since all cars are moving at the same speed, the time it takes for the two sets of cars to meet each other is simply the time it takes for them to cover the total distance between them, which is twice the number of cars. Once we have this time, we can simply multiply it by the number of cars in one set to get the total number of collisions.",

The left-moving cars start at positions 1 to n, while the right-moving cars start at positions 2n to n+1 (i.e. they are initially far away from each other). Then, it simulates the movement of the cars by checking each pair of cars to see if they will collide, and counting the collisions. To optimize the simulation, it checks if any other pair of cars will collide before the current pair, and skips the current pair if so. This avoids unnecessary calculations and improves efficiency."

			"Here's a possible solution using the built-in `int` function to convert the binary strings to integers, applying the XOR operator (`^`) and converting the result back to a binary string using the `format` function:\n\n```\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Perform binary XOR on two binary strings and return the result.\"\"\"\n    return format(int(a, 2) ^ int(b, 2), 'b')\n```\n\nThis function first converts the input strings `a` and `b` to integers using the `int` function with base `2` (binary). Then, it applies the XOR operator (`^`) to these integers, which computes the bitwise XOR between their binary representations. Finally, it converts the result back to a binary string using the `format` function with the format specifier `'b'`.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input strings `a` and `b` have the same length. If this is not the case, the function may return unexpected results or raise an error. It's up to the caller to ensure that the input is valid.",
			"Here's a possible solution to complete the function:\n\n```python\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    assert len(a) == len(b), \"Inputs must have the same length\"\n    # Convert strings to integer lists\n    a_list = [int(x) for x in a]\n    b_list = [int(x) for x in b]\n    # Perform XOR operation on each pair of bits\n    xor_list = [a_list[i] ^ b_list[i] for i in range(len(a_list))]\n    # Convert result back to string\n    xor_str = ''.join(str(x) for x in xor_list)\n    return xor_str\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input strings have the same length, and raises an exception if they don't. Then it converts each string to a list of integers (0 or 1), and uses a list comprehension to perform the XOR operation on each pair of bits. Finally, it converts the resulting list back to a string using `join()`, and returns it."
