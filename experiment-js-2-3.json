			"To find the largest number that divides n evenly and is smaller than n, we can start by checking if n is divisible by n-1, then n-2, and so on until we find a number that divides n evenly. Once we find such a number, we can return it as the largest divisor.\n\nHere's the code for the `largest_divisor` function:\n\n```\nfunction largest_divisor(n) {\n  for (let i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n    if (n % i === 0) {\n      return i;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we start the loop at `n-1` and decrement `i` in each iteration until we reach `1`. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n % i` is equal to `0`, then `i` is a divisor of `n`. We return `i` as the largest divisor.\n\nFor example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the loop will start at `14` and check if `15` is divisible by `14`. Since it is not, the loop will decrement `i` to `13` and check if `15` is divisible by `13`. Again, it is not, so we continue decrementing `i` until we reach `5`. At `i = 5`, we find that `15 % 5` is equal to `0`, so we return `5` as the largest divisor.",

We continue this process up to `n/2` to find the largest divisor that divides `n` evenly.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```\nfunction largest_divisor(n) {\n  for (let i = Math.floor(n/2); i > 0; i--) {\n    if (n % i === 0) {\n      return i;\n    }\n  }\n  return 1;\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we start the loop from `n/2` and decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration. We check if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, we return `i` as the largest divisor.

The function takes in a positive integer `n` as its argument.\n2. We initialize the variable `largest` to be 1. This will hold the largest divisor we find.\n3. We loop through all the integers from 2 to `n-1` and check if they divide `n` evenly. We do this by checking if `n % i === 0`.\n4.

The second test case has an even number of elements, so we need to find the middle two elements which are 6 and 10. Their average is 15, which is the median of the array.",
			"To find the median of a list of numbers, we first need to sort the list in ascending order. Once the list is sorted, we can determine if the length of the list is odd or even. \n\n- If the length of the list is odd, we simply return the middle element. For example, if we have a list of length 5, the middle element is at index 2 (since indexing starts at 0).\n- If the length of the list is even, we need to take the average of the two middle elements. For example, if we have a list of length 6, the middle elements are at index 2 and 3. We take the sum of these elements and divide by 2 to get the average.\n\nHere's the code to implement this logic:\n\n```\nfunction median(l) {\n  // sort the list in ascending order\n  l.sort(function(a, b) { return a - b; });\n  \n  // determine the middle index/indices\n  var middle = Math.floor(l.length / 2);\n  \n  // check if the length of the list is odd or even\n  if (l.length % 2 === 0) {\n    // average the two middle elements\n    return (l[middle - 1] + l[middle]) / 2;\n  } else {\n    // return the middle element\n    return l[middle];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe first sort the list using the `sort` method and a comparison function that orders elements in ascending order. We then calculate the middle index using `Math.floor` and check if the length of the list is odd or even using the modulus operator. Finally, we return either the middle element or the average of the two middle elements.",

For example, if the array has 5 elements, the middle index would be 2.\n\n3. We then check if the length of the array is odd or even using the modulus operator (`%`). If it's odd, we return the middle element of the array. If it's even, we calculate the average of the middle two elements and return that value.\n\nBy following these steps, the function is able to accurately calculate the median of the elements in the array.",

If the length of the array is odd, we return the middle element. If the length of the array is even, we return the average of the two middle elements.\n\nHere's the function that fulfills this prompt:\n\n```\nfunction median(l) {\n  const sorted = l.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  const len = sorted.length;\n  const middle = Math.floor(len / 2);\n\n  if (len % 2 === 0) {\n    return (sorted[middle - 1] + sorted[middle]) / 2;\n  } else {\n    return sorted[middle];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we first sort the input array `l` using the `sort` method and a custom comparison function that sorts the elements in ascending order. We then compute the length of the sorted array and the index of the middle element using the `Math.floor` function. \n\nWe then check whether the length of the array is even or odd using the modulus operator `%`. If the length is even, we compute the average of the two middle elements and return it. If the length is odd, we return the middle element.\n\nFor example, calling `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` will return `3`, since the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the middle element is `3`. Calling `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])` will return `15.0`, since the sorted array is `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]` and the two middle elements are `6` and `10`, and their average is `15.0`."

It starts with the first operand, then applies the first operation to the first and second operands, then applies the second operation to the result and the third operand, and so on until it has applied all the operations to all the operands.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result of the algebraic expression.\n\nHere's the code for the `do_algebra` function:\n\n```\nfunction do_algebra(operator, operand) {\n  let result = operand[0]; // start with the first operand\n  for (let i = 0; i < operator.length; i++) {\n    // apply each operator to the current result and the next operand\n    switch(operator[i]) {\n      case '+':\n        result += operand[i+1];\n        break;\n      case '-':\n        result -= operand[i+1];\n        break;\n      case '*':\n        result *= operand[i+1];\n        break;\n      case '//':\n        result = Math.floor(result / operand[i+1]);\n        break;\n      case '**':\n        result = Math.pow(result, operand[i+1]);\n        break;\n      default:\n        throw new Error(`Invalid operator: ${operator[i]}`);\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nThe function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the `operator` array. Inside the loop, it uses a `switch` statement to apply the appropriate operation to the current `result` and the next operand in the `operand` array. If an invalid operator is encountered, the function throws an error.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result of the algebraic expression.",
			"\n\nThe given prompt requires us to build an algebraic expression using two arrays - an array of basic algebra operations and an array of integers. We will then evaluate this expression and return the result.\n\nWe can approach this problem by iterating over the operator array and using each operator to perform the corresponding operation on the operands array. We will start with the first two elements of the operand array and the first operator in the operator array. We will then perform the operation and replace the first two elements of the operand array with the result. We will continue doing this for all the operators in the operator array until we have evaluated the entire expression.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```\nfunction do_algebra(operator, operand) {\n  let result = operand[0];\n  for (let i = 0; i < operator.length; i++) {\n    const op = operator[i];\n    const num = operand[i+1];\n    if (op === '+') {\n      result += num;\n    } else if (op === '-') {\n      result -= num;\n    } else if (op === '*') {\n      result *= num;\n    } else if (op === '//') {\n      result = Math.floor(result / num);\n    } else if (op === '**') {\n      result = Math.pow(result, num);\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nWe start with the first element of the operand array as the initial value of the result. We then iterate over the operator array using a for loop, and for each operator, we get the corresponding number from the operand array. We then perform the operation based on the current operator and update the value of the result.\n\nIf the operator is '+', we add the number to the result. If it is '-', we subtract the number from the result. If it is '*', we multiply the result by the number. If it is '//', we perform floor division by dividing the result by the number and rounding down to the nearest integer. If it is '**', we perform exponentiation by raising the result to the power of the number.\n\nFinally, we return the result after evaluating the entire expression.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input arrays are valid and meet the requirements specified in the prompt.",
			"\n\nThe `do_algebra` function takes two arguments: `operator` and `operand`. \n\n`operator` is an array of basic algebra operations (+, -, *, //, **) and `operand` is an array of integers. The function builds and evaluates the algebraic expression using the given arrays.\n\nHere's the code for the `do_algebra` function:\n\n```\nfunction do_algebra(operator, operand) {\n  let expression = operand[0];\n  for (let i = 0; i < operator.length; i++) {\n    switch (operator[i]) {\n      case '+':\n        expression += operand[i + 1];\n        break;\n      case '-':\n        expression -= operand[i + 1];\n        break;\n      case '*':\n        expression *= operand[i + 1];\n        break;\n      case '//':\n        expression = Math.floor(expression / operand[i + 1]);\n        break;\n      case '**':\n        expression **= operand[i + 1];\n        break;\n      default:\n        throw new Error('Invalid operator');\n    }\n  }\n  return expression;\n}\n```\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `expression` with the first element of the `operand` array.\n\nThen, it iterates over the `operator` array using a `for` loop. For each operator, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on `expression` using the next element from the `operand` array.\n\nFor example, if the operator is `+`, it adds the next element of the `operand` array to `expression`.\n\nIf the operator is `//`, it uses the `Math.floor` function to perform integer division and assigns the result back to `expression`.\n\nIf the operator is `**`, it uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to raise `expression` to the power of the next element of the `operand` array.\n\nIf the `operator` array contains an invalid operator, the function throws an `Error`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the evaluated `expression` value.\n\nFor example, given the following input:\n\n```\nconst operator = ['+', '*', '-'];\nconst operand = [2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nconsole.log(do_algebra(operator, operand)); // Output: 9\n```\n\nThe function will build and evaluate the algebraic expression: `2 + 3 * 4 - 5 = 9`.",

Then, if there is an operator corresponding to that operand (i.e. if we haven't reached the last operand in the array), it adds that operator to the `expression` variable as well.\n\nAfter the loop has finished, the function uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the `expression` variable and assign the result to the `result` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` variable.\n\nNote that `eval()` is generally not recommended for security reasons, but in this case it is a simple and efficient way to evaluate the algebraic expression.",

It takes a list `l` as an input.\n2. It initializes `max` to be the first element in the list. We assume that the first element is the maximum element initially.\n3. Then, it loops through the rest of the elements in the list using a `for` loop, starting from the second element (i.e., index 1).\n4. For each element, it compares it with `max`. If the current element is greater than `max`, it updates `max` to be the current element.\n5. After looping through all the elements, it returns `max` as the maximum element in the list.",

For each element, we check if it is greater than the current `max_num`. If it is, then we update `max_num` to be that element.\n4. After we've looped through all the elements, we return the value of `max_num`.\n\nHere's the code for the `max_element` function:\n\n```\nfunction max_element(l) {\n  let max_num = l[0];\n  \n  for (let i = 1; i < l.length; i++) {\n    let num = l[i];\n    if (num > max_num) {\n      max_num = num;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return max_num;\n}\n```\n\nWe can now call the `max_element` function with a list as input and it will return the maximum element in the list.

As the two cars approach each other, they will collide at the midpoint of the distance between them.\n\nTherefore, the total number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that are traveling towards each other. Since there are `n` cars in each set, there are `n` pairs of cars.

We know that all the cars move with the same speed, and they will continue to move in their direction after collision. Therefore, we can assume that the distance between two cars that are moving towards each other decreases at a constant rate.\n\nTo calculate the distance between each pair of cars, we can use the formula `distance = speed * time`.

If one car moving left to right collides with a car moving right to left, it will not collide with any other car moving right to left. Similarly, the car moving right to left will not collide with any other car moving left to right.\n\nTherefore, we need to calculate the number of unique collisions that can occur. This can be done by using combinations.\n\nWe can choose one car moving left to right and one car moving right to left in nC1 * nC1 ways.

The function calculates the number of collisions that will occur between the left-to-right moving cars and the right-to-left moving cars, assuming that all cars move at the same constant speed.\n\nTo calculate the number of collisions, we first need to determine the distance between the two sets of cars. Since the cars are infinitely far apart, we can assume that they start at positions `0` and `2n` on the road. The time it takes for the two sets of cars to collide can be calculated as the distance between them divided by the total speed of the two cars, which is twice the speed of one car. Thus, the time to collision is `2n / (2v) = n/v`, where `v` is the speed of each car.\n\nOnce we have the time to collision, we can calculate the position of each car at that time. The position of a left-to-right moving car is `v * t`, where `t` is the time to collision, and the position of a right-to-left moving car is `2n - v * t`. If the position of a left-to-right moving car is less than or equal to the position of a right-to-left moving car at the time of collision, then a collision occurs.\n\nWe can iterate through all pairs of left-to-right and right-to-left moving cars to determine if a collision occurs.

Finally, we sort and return the new list.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```\nfunction unique_digits(x) {\n  let result = [];\n  \n  // Iterate through each element in the array\n  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {\n    let hasEvenDigit = false;\n    \n    // Convert the integer to a string and check each character for even digits\n    for (let j = 0; j < x[i].toString().length; j++) {\n      if (parseInt(x[i].toString()[j]) % 2 === 0) {\n        hasEvenDigit = true;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    \n    // If the element doesn't have any even digits, add it to the result list\n    if (!hasEvenDigit) {\n      result.push(x[i]);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Sort and return the result list\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n```\n\nSo, for example, `unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])` would return `[1, 15, 33]`, and `unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])` would return `[]`.",
			"The `unique_digits` function takes an array of positive integers as the input parameter. It returns a new array that contains only the elements that do not have any even digit. The returned array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nTo implement this function, we can use a loop to iterate through each number in the input array. For each number, we can convert it to a string and check if any of its digits is even. If none of the digits are even, we add the number to a new array. Finally, we sort the new array and return it.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `unique_digits` function:\n\n```\nfunction unique_digits(x) {\n  let result = [];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {\n    let digits = x[i].toString().split(\"\");\n    let hasEvenDigit = false;\n\n    for (let j = 0; j < digits.length; j++) {\n      if (digits[j] % 2 === 0) {\n        hasEvenDigit = true;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (!hasEvenDigit) {\n      result.push(x[i]);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n```\n\nHere are some examples of using the `unique_digits` function:\n\n```\nconsole.log(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])); // [1, 15, 33]\nconsole.log(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])); // []\n```\n\nIn the first example, the input array contains four numbers, but only three of them (15, 33, and 1) have no even digits. These three numbers are added to the `result` array, which is then sorted in ascending order.\n\nIn the second example, none of the numbers in the input array have no even digits, so the `result` array is empty.",
			"To solve this prompt, we need to iterate through each number in the given array and check if it contains any even digit. We can check this by converting the number to a string and iterating through each character of the string to check if it is even.

We then iterate through each number in the input array `x` using a for loop. For each number, we first set a boolean variable `hasEvenDigit` to false. We then convert the number to a string using the `toString()` method and iterate through each character of the string using another for loop. For each character, we check if it is even by converting it to an integer using the `parseInt()` method and checking if it is divisible by 2. If we find any even digit, we set the `hasEvenDigit` variable to true and break out of the inner loop. If we don't find any even digit, we add that number to the `result` array using the `push()` method. Finally, we sort the `result` array in increasing order using the `sort()` method and return it.\n\nI hope this helps!",
