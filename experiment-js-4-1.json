			"To find the largest divisor of a given number 'n', we can start from n-1 and check if it divides n evenly. If it does, we can return that number as the largest divisor.

If it does, we return that number as the largest divisor. If none of the numbers divide n evenly, we return 1. \n\nFor example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will loop through the numbers 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and return 5 as it's the largest divisor of 15 that's smaller than 15 and divides it evenly.",
			"The `largest_divisor` function takes in a number `n` as its argument and returns the largest number that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`.\n\nTo find the largest divisor of `n`, we can start by dividing `n` by 2 and then checking whether the remainder is zero. If it is, then 2 is a divisor of `n`. If not, we can move to the next number and check whether it is a divisor. We can repeat this process until we find a divisor or until we reach `n/2`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `largest_divisor` function:\n\n```\nfunction largest_divisor(n) {\n  for (let i = Math.floor(n/2); i >= 2; i--) {\n    if (n % i === 0) {\n      return i;\n    }\n  }\n  return 1;\n}\n```\n\nFirst, we initialize a loop that starts from `n/2` and moves downwards. We use `Math.floor` to get the largest integer less than or equal to `n/2`. We start from `n/2` because any divisor of `n` must be less than or equal to `n/2`.\n\nInside the loop, we check whether `i` is a divisor of `n` by checking whether `n % i` is equal to zero. If it is, then we return `i` as the largest divisor.\n\nIf we reach the end of the loop and still haven't found a divisor, then `1` is the largest divisor of `n`. We return `1` in this case.\n\nFor example, calling `largest_divisor(15)` will return `5`, which is the largest number that divides `15` evenly and is smaller than `15`.",

			"\n\nTo find the median of the given array, we first need to sort it in ascending order. We can then check if the length of the array is odd or even. If it is odd, then the median will be the middle element. If it is even, then the median will be the average of the two middle elements. Here is the function that implements this:\n\n```\nfunction median(l) {\n  // sort the array in ascending order\n  l.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});\n  var n = l.length;\n  // check if the length is odd or even\n  if (n % 2 == 0) {\n    // if even, average the two middle elements\n    return (l[n/2 - 1] + l[n/2]) / 2;\n  } else {\n    // if odd, return the middle element\n    return l[(n-1)/2];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet's see how this function works with the given examples:\n\n```\n// Example 1\nvar arr1 = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5];\nconsole.log(median(arr1)); // Output: 3\n\n// Example 2\nvar arr2 = [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20];\nconsole.log(median(arr2)); // Output: 15.0\n``` \n\nIn the first example, the sorted array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Since the length of the array is odd, the median is the middle element, which is 3.\n\nIn the second example, the sorted array would be [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]. Since the length of the array is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements, which are 6 and 10. So the median is (6 + 10) / 2 = 15.0.",

The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the list has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nTo calculate the median, the function first sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort` method with a custom comparison function that subtracts each element from the next one. Then, it finds the middle index of the array by dividing its length by 2 and rounding down using the `Math.floor` method.\n\nIf the array length is odd, the function simply returns the element at the middle index using array indexing notation (`l[middleIndex]`).

If the length of the array is odd, we return the middle element. We calculate the index of the middle element by dividing the length of the array by 2 and using the `Math.floor()` method to round down to the nearest integer.\n\n5. If the length of the array is even, we return the average of the middle two elements. We calculate the indices of the middle two elements by dividing the length of the array by 2 and subtracting 1 from one of the indices (this is because array indices start at 0).\n\n6.

If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is simply the middle element of the sorted array, which is returned.\n4. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted array, which is returned.\n\nSo, for example, when we call `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])`, the function sorts the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and returns the middle element, `3`. Similarly, when we call `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])`, the function sorts the array to `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]` and returns the average of the two middle elements, which is `15.0`."

We use the spread syntax (`...l`) to pass the array as individual arguments to the `Math.max()` method. This will return the maximum value in the array.\n\nFor example, `max_element([1, 2, 3])` will return `3`, and `max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])` will return `123`.",

It first sets the first element of the array as the maximum value. Then, it iterates through the rest of the array and compares each element to the current maximum value. If an element is greater than the maximum value, it replaces the maximum value with that element. After iterating through the entire array, the function returns the maximum value.\n\nFor example, if we call `max_element([1, 2, 3])`, the function will first set `max` to 1. Then, it will iterate through the array and find that 3 is greater than the current maximum value of 1, so it will replace `max` with 3.

			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions that occur between the `n` cars driving left to right and the `n` cars driving right to left on an infinitely long straight road.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can simulate the motion of the cars on the road using two arrays, `leftToRight` and `rightToLeft`, each of length `n`. We can initialize these arrays to contain the positions of the `n` cars on the road at time zero. We can assume that the leftmost car on the `leftToRight` array is at position zero, and the leftmost car on the `rightToLeft` array is at position `2n`, i.e., they are very far from each other.\n\nWe can then simulate the motion of the cars by iterating over time in discrete steps. At each time step, we update the position of each car by adding its speed to its current position. We can assume that all cars have the same speed.\n\nTo check for collisions, we can compare the positions of the cars in the `leftToRight` and `rightToLeft` arrays at each time step. If the position of a car in the `leftToRight` array is greater than or equal to the position of a car in the `rightToLeft` array, then a collision has occurred. We can count the number of collisions that occur and return the count at the end of the simulation.\n\nHere's the code for the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  let leftToRight = Array(n).fill(0);\n  let rightToLeft = Array(n).fill(2 * n);\n  let collisions = 0;\n  const speed = 1;\n\n  for (let t = 0; t < 2 * n; t++) {\n    // Update car positions\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      leftToRight[i] += speed;\n      rightToLeft[i] -= speed;\n    }\n\n    // Check for collisions\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      if (leftToRight[i] >= rightToLeft[i]) {\n        collisions++;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return collisions;\n}\n```\n\nWe start by initializing the `leftToRight` and `rightToLeft` arrays with zeros and `2n`, respectively.

It calculates the total number of collisions by multiplying `n` by itself since each car moving in one direction can collide with every car moving in the opposite direction. The result is returned as the output of the function.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 5, then there are 5 cars moving left to right and 5 cars moving right to left. The total number of collisions possible would be `5 * 5 = 25`.",
			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars in each direction on an infinitely long straight road. The function then calculates the number of collisions that will occur between the cars moving in opposite directions.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can imagine that the left-to-right cars are moving towards a fixed point, while the right-to-left cars are moving away from that same point. We can then calculate the time it will take for each pair of cars to collide, and check if the collision will actually occur within the given time interval.\n\nAssuming that all cars are moving at the same speed, we can calculate the time it takes for two cars to collide as the distance between them divided by twice their speed. For example, if the distance between two cars is `d` and their speed is `s`, then the time it takes for them to collide is `d / (2 * s)`.\n\nTo calculate the total number of collisions, we can loop through all pairs of cars and check if they will collide within the given time interval. If so, we increment a counter variable and return the final value of the counter.\n\nHere is the full implementation of the function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  let collisionCount = 0;\n  const carDistance = 1000; // assuming each car is 1000 meters apart\n  const carSpeed = 50; // assuming each car is moving at 50 m/s\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n      const leftCarDistance = carDistance + (i * carDistance);\n      const rightCarDistance = carDistance + (j * carDistance);\n      const collisionTime = (leftCarDistance + rightCarDistance) / (2 * carSpeed);\n      if (collisionTime < Infinity) {\n        collisionCount++;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return collisionCount;\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we assume that each car is initially 1000 meters apart, and that each car is moving at a speed of 50 meters per second. These values can be adjusted to match the specific requirements of the problem.\n\nThe function loops through all pairs of cars, calculates the time it will take for them to collide, and increments a counter variable if a collision will occur within the given time interval.

It then calculates the total number of possible collisions using the formula `n * (n - 1) / 2`. This formula calculates the total number of combinations of two cars out of `n` cars, which is the total number of possible collisions.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total number of possible collisions.

It then calculates the number of collisions that will occur between the left-to-right and right-to-left cars.\n\nThe basic idea is that each left-to-right car will collide with a right-to-left car at some point, unless it is the last left-to-right car or the first right-to-left car. Therefore, we only need to count the number of pairs of cars (one from each direction) that will collide.\n\nTo do this, we can use a formula for the number of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time: `n * (n-1) / 2`. This gives us the total number of possible pairs of cars. However, since each pair is counted twice (once for the left-to-right car and once for the right-to-left car), we need to divide by 2 to get the final answer.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all cars are moving at the same speed, and that collisions occur instantly (i.e. the cars continue moving as if nothing happened). It also assumes that the road is straight and infinitely long, and that there are no other obstacles or factors that could affect the cars' trajectories.",

We then calculate the number of collisions that will occur as `n*(n-1)/2`. This formula works because, for each of the `n` left-to-right cars, there are `n-1` right-to-left cars that it could potentially collide with. However, we don't want to count each collision twice (once for each car involved), so we divide by 2 to get the total number of unique collisions.\n\nFinally, we return the total number of collisions.",
			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n)` takes a parameter `n` which indicates the number of cars on each side of the road. It simulates a scenario where `n` cars are moving left to right and another set of `n` cars are moving right to left on a straight, infinitely long road.\n\nThe function calculates the number of collisions that occur between the two sets of cars. A collision is said to occur when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their original direction after the collision.\n\nTo calculate the number of collisions, we can consider that each car moving left to right will collide with exactly one car moving right to left. Therefore, the total number of collisions would be equal to the number of cars moving left to right or the number of cars moving right to left (since they are the same).\n\nHence, the function simply returns the value `n`, which represents the number of cars on each side of the road and also the number of collisions that occur between the two sets of cars.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function in JavaScript:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  return n;\n}\n```",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we can assume that all cars are points on a line, and we know their directions of motion (left to right or right to left). We can represent the cars by their positions on the line and their direction of motion using tuples. For example, a car moving left to right starting at position 3 on the line can be represented as `(3, 'L')` where 'L' represents the left direction.\n\nWe can then create two lists of n tuples each, one for left to right cars and one for right to left cars. We can sort these lists by the position of the cars on the line.\n\nAfter sorting, we can iterate over both lists simultaneously and check if there are any collisions. If a car moving left to right is at a position less than or equal to a car moving right to left, then they will collide. We can count such collisions and return the total count at the end.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n):\n    left_to_right = [(i, 'L') for i in range(n)]\n    right_to_left = [(i, 'R') for i in range(n, 2*n)]\n    cars = sorted(left_to_right + right_to_left, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    collisions = 0\n    for i in range(len(cars)-1):\n        if cars[i][1] == 'L' and cars[i+1][1] == 'R':\n            if cars[i][0] <= cars[i+1][0]:\n                collisions += 1\n    return collisions\n```\n\nWe first create two lists, `left_to_right` and `right_to_left`, each containing tuples representing the cars moving in each direction. We then merge these two lists into a single list `cars` and sort it based on the position of the cars.\n\nNext, we iterate over the sorted list of cars and check for collisions between adjacent cars. If a car moving left to right is at a position less than or equal to a car moving right to left, we count it as a collision.\n\nFinally, we return the total number of collisions.",

It then calculates the number of possible collision points between the two sets of cars using the formula `n * (n-1) / 2`. This formula calculates the number of unique combinations of two cars that can collide.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 3, then there are three cars driving left to right and three cars driving right to left. The possible collision points are between car 1 driving left to right and car 1 driving right to left, car 1 driving left to right and car 2 driving right to left, car 1 driving left to right and car 3 driving right to left, car 2 driving left to right and car 2 driving right to left, car 2 driving left to right and car 3 driving right to left, and car 3 driving left to right and car 3 driving right to left.

Therefore, if the distance between any two such cars is d, they will collide after a time of t = d/(2s).\n\nWe can use this idea to find all the collisions. First, we can generate the positions of all the cars randomly such that they are far apart from each other. We can store the positions of the cars moving from left to right in one list, and the positions of the cars moving from right to left in another list.\n\nNext, we can sort both lists in ascending order.

The function generates random positions for the cars between 0 and 1, and stores them in two arrays: `leftToRightPositions` and `rightToLeftPositions`.\n3. The positions in both arrays are sorted in ascending order.\n4. The function uses two indices, `ltrIndex` and `rtlIndex`, to iterate through the positions in both arrays.\n5. The function checks if a left to right car has passed a right to left car. If it has, the `ltrIndex` is incremented.\n6. If a right to left car has passed a left to right car, the `rtlIndex` is incremented and the number of left to right cars that have passed (i.e., those with positions less than the position of the current right to left car) is added to the `collisions` variable.\n7. The function continues iterating through the arrays until it reaches the end of one of the",
			"Here is a possible implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  // The distance between two cars is constant and equal to 1.\n  // Therefore, a collision occurs when the sum of the positions\n  // of the left-to-right and right-to-left cars is an odd integer.\n  // We can use a loop to count the number of collisions.\n  let count = 0;\n  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    if ((i + n) % 2 === 1) {\n      count++;\n    }\n  }\n  return count;\n}\n```\n\nThe function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars driving left to right and right to left. The distance between two cars is assumed to be 1 unit. The function uses a loop to iterate over the left-to-right cars and check if each car collides with a right-to-left car. This is done by computing the sum of the positions of the two cars and checking if it is an odd integer. If so, a collision has occurred and the collision count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total number of collisions.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 4, there are 4 left-to-right cars and 4 right-to-left cars, and the function will check all possible pairs of cars for collisions. If the left-to-right cars are initially at positions [1, 2, 3, 4] and the right-to-left cars are initially at positions [8, 9, 10, 11], the function will return 2, since the cars at positions 2 and 9, and the cars at positions 3 and 10, will collide.",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we can imagine that the left-moving cars are stationary and the right-moving cars are moving towards them with the same speed. Then, we can calculate the distance between each pair of cars and see if they collide or not.\n\nWe can represent the positions of the cars using an array of length 2n. The first n elements represent the positions of the left-moving cars, and the last n elements represent the positions of the right-moving cars. We can assume that the left-moving cars are initially positioned at [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1] and the right-moving cars are initially positioned at [2n-1, 2n-2, ..., n].\n\nThen, we can iterate over each pair of cars and calculate their distance. If the distance is even, it means they will collide. We can increment a counter for each collision and return the final count.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  let positions = [...Array(2*n).keys()]; // initialize positions\n  let collisions = 0;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    let leftCar = positions[i];\n    let rightCar = positions[2*n-1-i];\n    let distance = rightCar - leftCar;\n    if (distance % 2 == 0) {\n      collisions++;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return collisions;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if we call `car_race_collision(4)`, it will return 4 because there are 4 pairs of cars that collide: (0,7), (1,6), (2,5), and (3,4).",
			"Here's the implementation of the function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  // Each car moving left to right will collide with the car moving right to left\n  // that's n positions away from it. So, we need to count the number of such cars.\n  // For example, if n is 3, we have the following pairs of cars:\n  // (1, 3), (2, 6), (3, 9)\n  // In general, the pairs are (i, i*n) for i from 1 to n.\n  // Therefore, the number of collisions is just n.\n\n  return n;\n}\n```\n\nThe function takes one argument `n`, which represents the number of cars moving left to right and right to left. The function calculates the number of collisions that will occur and returns it.\n\nThe logic of the function is pretty simple. Each car moving left to right will collide with the car moving right to left that's `n` positions away from it. So, we need to count the number of such cars. For example, if `n` is 3, we have the following pairs of cars:\n\n- Car 1 moving left to right collides with car 3 moving right to left\n- Car 2 moving left to right collides with car 6 moving right to left\n- Car 3 moving left to right collides with car 9 moving right to left\n\nIn general, the pairs are `(i, i*n)` for `i` from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the number of collisions is just `n`."
