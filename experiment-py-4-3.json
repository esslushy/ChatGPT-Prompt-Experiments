			"Sure, here's the complete function for the given prompt:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (n - 1) // 2\n```\n\nThe function calculates the number of collisions based on the number of cars `n` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The formula works because each car moving left to right can potentially collide with `n - 1` cars moving right to left, and we need to count each collision only once (hence the division by 2)."
