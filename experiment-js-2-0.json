The second array contains integers that will be used to build the algebraic expression. \n\nThe function will evaluate the expression and return the result. \n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```\nfunction do_algebra(operator, operand){\n  let expression = operand[0];\n  for(let i = 0; i < operator.length; i++){\n    switch(operator[i]){\n      case '+':\n        expression += operand[i+1];\n        break;\n      case '-':\n        expression -= operand[i+1];\n        break;\n      case '*':\n        expression *= operand[i+1];\n        break;\n      case '//':\n        expression = Math.floor(expression / operand[i+1]);\n        break;\n      case '**':\n        expression = Math.pow(expression, operand[i+1]);\n        break;\n      default:\n        return \"Invalid operator\";\n    }\n  }\n  return expression;\n}\n```\n\nThe function first initializes the `expression` variable to the first integer in the `operand` array.\n\nThen, it uses a `for` loop to iterate through the `operator` array.\n\nInside the loop, a `switch` statement is used to check which operator is present at the current index. The corresponding operation is performed on the `expression` variable and the next integer in the `operand` array.\n\nFinally, the resulting `expression` is returned as the output of the function.\n\nNote that the `Math.floor()` method is used to perform floor division as there is no dedicated floor division operator in JavaScript.\n\nAlso, the function returns an error message if an invalid operator is encountered in the `operator` array.",

It then evaluates the expression and returns the result.\n\nThe function first sets the initial expression to the first value in the `operand` array. It then loops through the `operator` array, applying each operator to the current expression and the next operand in the `operand` array.\n\nThe `switch` statement handles each operator case. For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, it simply applies the operator to the current expression and next operand using the appropriate arithmetic operator. For floor division, it uses the `Math.floor` function to round down the result of dividing the current expression by the next operand. For exponentiation, it uses the `Math.pow` function to raise the current expression to the power of the next operand.\n\nIf an invalid operator is encountered in the `operator` array, the function returns an error message indicating the invalid operator.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result of the evaluated expression.",

The `operator` array contains basic algebra operators and the `operand` array contains integers. \n\nThe function first sets the initial value of the expression to the first element of the `operand` array. It then loops through the `operator` array and for each operator, it performs the corresponding operation on the current expression and the next operand in the `operand` array. \n\nFor example, if the current operator is `+`, it adds the next operand to the current expression using the `+=` operator. Similarly, for subtraction, it uses the `-=` operator, for multiplication, it uses the `*=` operator, for floor division, it uses the `Math.floor()` function, and for exponentiation, it uses the `**=` operator.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of the expression after all the operations have been performed.",

For example, `max_element([1, 2, 3])` will return `3` and `max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])` will return `123`.",

It initializes the maximum element to be the first element of the array, then loops through the rest of the array. For each element in the array, it checks if that element is greater than the current maximum element. If it is, the maximum element is updated to be that element. Once the loop is finished, the function returns the maximum element. \n\nFor example, if we call `max_element([1, 2, 3])`, the function will first set `max_elem` to be 1. It will then loop through the rest of the array (2 and 3), and update `max_elem` to be 2 and then 3.

			"The `can_arrange` function takes an array as an input and returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.

Then it iterates through the array using a `for` loop starting from the second element (index 1). If the current element is less than the previous element, it sets the `index` variable to the index of the previous element. This way, the `index` variable stores the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. \n\nAt the end of the loop, the function returns the `index` variable. If no such element exists, the `index` variable will still be -1, so the function will return -1. \n\nFor example, if we call `can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5])`, the function will return 3 because the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it is 3 (corresponding to the number 3 in the array).

If so, it checks if the index of the preceding element is greater than `maxIndex`, and updates `maxIndex` if it is. \n\nAt the end of the loop, `maxIndex` will contain the index of the largest element in the array that is not greater than the element immediately preceding it.

			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars traveling in each direction on an infinitely long straight road. The function returns an integer, which represents the number of collisions that occur between the two sets of cars.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can assume that the cars are initially lined up in a straight line, with the `n` cars traveling left to right on one side of the line and the `n` cars traveling right to left on the other side of the line. We can also assume that all of the cars are traveling at the same speed.\n\nSince the cars are infinitely sturdy and will continue moving after colliding, we only need to count the number of collisions that occur at any point in time. We can do this by observing that a car traveling left to right will collide with a car traveling right to left if and only if the two cars are at the same position on the road at the same time. Therefore, we can iterate through all possible pairs of cars (one traveling left to right and one traveling right to left) and check if they collide at any point in time.\n\nThe number of collisions can be tracked using a counter variable, which is incremented each time a collision is detected. Finally, the function returns the total number of collisions.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `car_race_collision(n)` function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  let numCollisions = 0;\n\n  // Iterate through all possible pairs of cars\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n      // Check if the two cars collide at any point in time\n      if (i === j) {\n        numCollisions++; // Collision detected\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return numCollisions;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the two sets of cars are equally distributed on either side of the road. If this is not the case, the function will need to be modified accordingly to ensure that all possible pairs of cars are checked for collisions."

If the last character is alphabetical, we need to check if it's part of a word. To do this, we first use the `trim` method to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input string. Then, we use the `split` method to separate the string into an array of words (using the space character as the separator).\n5. We get the last word in the array by using the `length` property and subtracting 1 (since arrays are zero-indexed). We then check if this word includes the last character we found earlier.

Return the sorted `result` list.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `unique_digits` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef unique_digits(x):\n    result = []\n    for num in x:\n        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):\n            result.append(num)\n    return sorted(result)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use the `all` function to check if all digits of the input number `num` are odd. We convert the number to a string and iterate over its digits using a generator expression. We apply the modulo operator `%` to each digit converted back to an integer and check if it is not equal to zero (i.e., odd). The `all` function returns `True` if all digits satisfy the condition, and `False` otherwise.\n\nWe then append the number `num` to the `result` list if all its digits are odd. Finally, we sort the `result` list in increasing order and return it.",
			"The `unique_digits` function takes an array of positive integers as input and returns a sorted array of all the elements that don't have any even digits.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```\nfunction unique_digits(x) {\n  const result = [];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {\n    const numStr = x[i].toString();\n    let hasEvenDigit = false;\n\n    for (let j = 0; j < numStr.length; j++) {\n      if (parseInt(numStr[j]) % 2 === 0) {\n        hasEvenDigit = true;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (!hasEvenDigit) {\n      result.push(x[i]);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n}\n```\n\nThe function starts by initializing an empty array called `result`. We will use this array to store all the elements that meet our criteria.\n\nNext, we loop through each element in the input array `x` using a `for` loop. For each element, we convert it to a string using the `toString()` method and store it in a variable called `numStr`.\n\nWe then initialize a boolean variable called `hasEvenDigit` to `false`. This variable will keep track of whether the current element has an even digit or not.\n\nNext, we loop through each digit in `numStr` using another `for` loop. For each digit, we use the `parseInt()` method to convert it back to an integer and check if it's even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If we find an even digit, we set `hasEvenDigit` to `true` and break out of the loop.\n\nAfter we've checked all the digits in the current element, we check the value of `hasEvenDigit`. If it's still `false`, it means that the current element doesn't have any even digits, so we push it to the `result` array.\n\nFinally, we sort the `result` array in increasing order using the `sort()` method with a comparator function that subtracts `a` from `b`.\n\nAt the end of the function, we return the `result` array.",
			"The function `unique_digits(x)` takes an array of positive integers as input and returns a sorted array of all elements that do not contain any even digit. The returned array is sorted in increasing order.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. Create an empty list `result` to hold the sorted list of unique digits.\n\n2. Iterate over each element `num` in the input array `x`.\n\n3. Convert `num` to a string so we can check its digits.\n\n4. Check if `num` contains any even digit. To do this, we convert each digit of `num` back to an integer and check if it is even. If any digit is even, we move on to the next element in `x`.\n\n5. If `num` does not contain any even digit, we add it to the `result` list.\n\n6. Once we have checked all elements in `x`, we sort the `result` list in increasing order and return it.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function:\n\n```\ndef unique_digits(x):\n    result = []\n    for num in x:\n        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):\n            result.append(num)\n    return sorted(result)\n```\n\nFor example, if we call `unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])`, the function will return `[1, 15, 33]`. If we call `unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])`, the function will return an empty list `[]`.",
			"To solve this prompt, we can start by creating an empty list called `result` which will contain all the elements that have no even digits. Then, we can loop through each element in the input array `x` and check if it has any even digits.\n\nIf it doesn't have any even digits, we append it to the `result` list.

Then, we check if all the digits are odd by using the `all` function to check if every digit modulo 2 is not equal to 0 (i.e. it's odd). If all the digits are odd, we append the number to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, we sort the `result` list in increasing order and return it.",
			"To solve this prompt, we can create a helper function called `has_even_digit()` that checks whether a number has any even digit or not. We can then use this helper function to filter out all the elements that have at least one even digit from the original array. Finally, we can sort the resulting array in increasing order and return it.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `unique_digits()` function in Python:\n\n```\ndef has_even_digit(num):\n    while num > 0:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            return True\n        num //= 10\n    return False\n\ndef unique_digits(x):\n    return sorted(filter(lambda n: not has_even_digit(n), x))\n```\n\nIn the `has_even_digit()` function, we use a while loop to check each digit of the number `num` by taking its modulus with 2. If the modulus is 0, it means the digit is even, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we divide `num` by 10 to move on to the next digit. If we have checked all the digits and haven't found any even digit, we return `False`.\n\nIn the `unique_digits()` function, we use the `filter()` function to remove all the elements from the `x` array that have at least one even digit. We pass a lambda function to `filter()` that calls the `has_even_digit()` function on each element of `x`. Finally, we sort the resulting array using the `sorted()` function and return it.",

The function first checks if the length of the input strings `a` and `b` are equal. If they are not equal, it throws an error.\n\n2. The function then initializes an empty result string `result`.\n\n3. It then iterates through each character of the input strings `a` and `b` using a for loop. \n\n4. For each character, the function checks if the characters in `a` and `b` are the same or different. If they are different, the function adds \"1\" to the result string `result`. If they are the same, it adds \"0\" to the result string `result`.\n\n5. After all characters have been processed, the function returns the result string `result`.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```\nfunction string_xor(a, b){\n  if (a.length !== b.length){\n    throw new Error(\"Input strings must have equal length\");\n  }\n  let result = \"\";\n  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++){\n    if (a[i] !== b[i]){\n      result += \"1\";\n    } else {\n      result += \"0\";\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n``` \n\nFor example, if we call `string_xor(\"010\", \"110\")`, the function will return `\"100\"` as the result.",
			"\n\nThe `string_xor` function takes two input strings `a` and `b`, consisting only of 1s and 0s. The function returns the binary XOR operation result of these two input strings as a new string.\n\nTo perform the XOR operation, we will iterate through each character of the two input strings `a` and `b`. We will compare each character of the two strings and if they are different, we will append \"1\" to a new string otherwise, we will append \"0\". Finally, we will return the new string as the XOR result.\n\nHere's the code implementation for the `string_xor` function:\n\n```\nfunction string_xor(a, b){\n  let xorResult = \"\";\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++){\n    if (a[i] !== b[i]){\n      xorResult += \"1\";\n    }\n    else {\n      xorResult += \"0\";\n    }\n  }\n\n  return xorResult;\n}\n```\n\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```\nconsole.log(string_xor(\"010\", \"110\")); // Output: \"100\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the binary XOR result of \"010\" and \"110\" is \"100\".",

It then loops through each character of the input strings and checks if the corresponding characters are the same. If they are, the function adds a \"0\" to the result string. If they are different, the function adds a \"1\" to the result string.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result string.\n\nFor example, if `a` is \"010\" and `b` is \"110\", the function will loop through each character and compare them as follows:\n\n```\na: 0 1 0\nb: 1 1 0\n   -----\nr: 1 0 0\n```\n\nThe function will return the binary string \"100\".",
			"\n\nThis function takes two binary strings as input - 'a' and 'b'. It performs a binary XOR (exclusive OR) operation between these two strings and returns the result as a string.\n\nThe binary XOR operation compares corresponding bits of the two input strings and returns a new string with a '1' in each bit position where the bits of 'a' and 'b' are different, and a '0' where they are the same.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. Convert the input strings 'a' and 'b' to arrays of bits using the split() method.\n2. Create an empty array to hold the result of the XOR operation.\n3. Use a for loop to iterate over each bit in the input strings.\n4. Use the XOR operator (^) to compare the corresponding bits of 'a' and 'b'.\n5. Append the result of the XOR operation to the output array using the push() method.\n6. Convert the output array back to a string using the join() method and return the result.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction string_xor(a, b){\n  let output = [];\n  let bits_a = a.split('');\n  let bits_b = b.split('');\n  \n  for(let i = 0; i < bits_a.length; i++){\n    let bit_result = bits_a[i] ^ bits_b[i];\n    output.push(bit_result);\n  }\n  \n  return output.join('');\n}\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(string_xor(\"010\", \"110\")); // \"100\"\nconsole.log(string_xor(\"101010\", \"111100\")); // \"010110\"\n```",
			"\n\nTo implement this function, we will first convert the binary strings `a` and `b` into their corresponding decimal values. We can do this using the built-in `int()` function in Python. Once we have the decimal values, we can perform the XOR operation on them using the `^` operator. The resulting decimal value will be converted back to a binary string using the built-in `bin()` function with a prefix of \"0b\" stripped off.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `string_xor()` function:\n\n```\ndef string_xor(a, b):\n    # Convert binary strings to decimal\n    a_dec = int(a, 2)\n    b_dec = int(b, 2)\n    \n    # Perform XOR operation\n    xor_dec = a_dec ^ b_dec\n    \n    # Convert decimal to binary string\n    xor_str = bin(xor_dec)[2:]\n    \n    return xor_str\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We start by defining the `string_xor()` function with two parameters `a` and `b`.\n2. We then use the `int()` function to convert the binary strings `a` and `b` into their corresponding decimal values `a_dec` and `b_dec`.\n3. We perform the XOR operation on `a_dec` and `b_dec` using the `^` operator and store the result in `xor_dec`.\n4. We convert `xor_dec` back to a binary string using the `bin()` function and strip off the \"0b\" prefix using the slice notation `[2:]`.\n5. Finally, we return the resulting binary string `xor_str`.\n\nLet's test the function with the example inputs from the prompt:\n\n```\n>>> string_xor(\"010\", \"110\")\n'100'\n```\n\nAs expected, the function returns the binary string \"100\", which is the result of performing the XOR operation on the binary strings \"010\" and \"110\"."
