We can then sort the cars by their starting position and loop over all pairs of adjacent cars on the road, checking if they are moving towards each other.

Therefore, we divide the number of pairs by 2 and return the result.",

It then initializes `cars_on_each_side` to `n`, since there are initially `n` cars on each side of the road.\n\nThe function then iterates over each pair of cars and calculates the collision point, which is the point at which the two cars will collide if they were to continue moving in their current trajectory. The collision point is calculated as `2 * cars_on_each_side - 1`.\n\nIf the collision point is less than `n`, this means that a collision will occur before the cars reach the end of the road. In this case, we increment the `collisions` counter.\n\nFinally, we decrement the number of cars on the right side, since each pair of cars has now passed each other.

			"\n\nHere's the implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n * (n - 1)\n```\n\nThe function returns the number of collisions based on the number of cars moving left to right and right to left. As each car moving left to right can collide with every car moving right to left except itself, the total number of collisions is the product of the number of cars moving left to right and the number of cars moving right to left, which is equal to `n * (n - 1)`.",
			"\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to use combinatorics. We can calculate the total number of possible collisions by multiplying the number of cars going left with the number of cars going right. However, we need to subtract the cases where no collisions occur.\n\nThe number of ways to choose two cars from n is n choose 2, which is equal to n(n-1)/2. Therefore, the total number of possible collisions is:\n\ntotal_collisions = n * (n-1) / 2 * n * (n-1) / 2\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cases where no collisions occur. The number of ways to choose one car from n is n choose 1, which is equal to n. Therefore, the number of ways to choose no cars from n is 1 (the empty set). Hence, the total number of cases with no collisions is:\n\nno_collisions = n * 1 * n * 1\n\nFinally, we can calculate the number of collisions by subtracting the number of cases with no collisions from the total number of possible collisions:\n\nnum_collisions = total_collisions - no_collisions\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    total_collisions = n * (n-1) / 2 * n * (n-1) / 2\n    no_collisions = n * 1 * n * 1\n    num_collisions = total_collisions - no_collisions\n    return int(num_collisions)",
			"\n\nHere's one way to implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # calculate the total number of possible collisions\n    total_collisions = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    # return the total number of possible collisions\n    return total_collisions\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function takes an integer argument `n` which represents the number of cars driving in each direction.\n- The total number of possible collisions can be calculated by finding the number of ways to choose 2 cars from `n` cars in each direction. This can be done using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `n choose 2`.\n- The function returns the total number of possible collisions.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that all cars are moving at the same speed and that they are all evenly spaced out along the road. If this is not the case, the function may need to be adjusted accordingly.",

This is because each car on one side has `n - 1` potential collisions with cars on the other side, since they all start out equally far apart. Multiplying this number by `n` gives us the total number of potential collisions.",

It then creates two lists: `left_to_right` and `right_to_left`. These lists represent the positions of the cars going left to right and right to left respectively.\n\nThe function then loops through all cars going left to right and all cars going right to left.
