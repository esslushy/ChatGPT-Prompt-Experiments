We can use the formula `2 * i + 1` to compute the distance between the ith car moving left to right and the ith car moving right to left. We add 1 to account for the fact that the two cars are separated by a distance of 1 initially.\n- We then use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of indices (i, j) and count the number of collisions. If the distance between the ith car moving left to right and the jth car moving right to left is less than or equal to the distance between the jth car moving left to right and the ith car moving right to left, then the two cars will collide at some point. We increment the `num_collisions` counter for each such pair (i, j).\n- Finally, we return the total number of collisions.",
