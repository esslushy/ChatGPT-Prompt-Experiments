If any of these conditions are not satisfied, the function raises a `ValueError` or `TypeError` with an appropriate message.\n\nAssuming the input lists are valid, the function builds the algebraic expression as a string using a loop that iterates over the operators and operands.

We initialize a variable `max_val` to negative infinity, and then iterate over the elements in the list using a `for` loop.

The function takes an integer `n` as input, which is the number of cars moving in each direction. The function outputs the number of collisions between the two sets of cars.\n\nThe function works by looping through all possible pairs of cars and checking if they are moving towards each other. If a pair of cars is moving towards each other, then a collision occurs and the number of collisions is incremented by 1. Once all possible pairs of cars have been checked, the function returns the total number of collisions.",

This gives us the total number of collisions that can occur, which is then returned as an integer."

Next, we split the string into words using the `split()` method. This splits the string at each space character and returns a list of words.\n\n3. We then get the last word in the list using the `[-1]` index. We also check if the last character of the original string (`txt[-1]`) is a letter.\n\n4. Finally, we check if the last character of the last word is a letter and is not part of a larger word by checking if the character before the last character of the last word is a space character (`txt[-len(last_word)-1] == ' '`). If both conditions are met, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.",

If there is only one word in the string, the function checks if the last character is a letter and not a space. If there are multiple words in the string, the function checks if the last character of the last word is a letter and if the last word is only one character long (which means it's not a part of a longer word). \n\nThe function returns True if the last character is a letter and not a part of a word, and False otherwise.",

Then, the function checks whether n is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of n, inclusive. If it is, then n is not a prime number.\n\n3. If the function completes the loop without finding any divisors, then n is a prime number.\n\nNote that we are only checking divisors up to the square root of n because if n is not a prime number, then it can be written as a product of two factors, one of which is less than or equal to its square root.",

			"Here's a possible implementation of the `unique_digits` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef unique_digits(x: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    def has_even_digit(n: int) -> bool:\n        return any(digit % 2 == 0 for digit in map(int, str(n)))\n    \n    return sorted(filter(lambda n: not has_even_digit(n), x))\n```\n\nThe function defines an inner function `has_even_digit` that checks if a given integer `n` contains any even digit. This is done by converting `n` to a string and then to a list of digits, which are checked for evenness using the modulo operator `%`.\n\nThe `unique_digits` function then returns a sorted list of the elements of `x` that don't have any even digit. This is done using the built-in `filter` function, which takes a predicate function (in this case `lambda n: not has_even_digit(n)`) and an iterable (`x`) and returns a new iterable that contains only the elements of the original iterable for which the predicate function returns `True`. The resulting iterable is then sorted using the built-in `sorted` function before being returned.",

It then performs the XOR operation on these binary integers using the `^` operator, and stores the result in the `result` variable.\n\nNext, the function converts the `result` integer back to a binary string using the `bin()` function with the `[2:]` slice to remove the leading `0b` characters. The resulting string may be shorter than the input strings, so the function pads it with leading zeroes using the `zfill()` method to ensure that it has the same length as the longest input string.\n\nFinally, the function returns the resulting binary string as the output.",
