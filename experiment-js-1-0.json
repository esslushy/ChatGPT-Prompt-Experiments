			"The function `largest_divisor` takes in a number `n` as its parameter and returns the largest number that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We start by initializing a variable `largest` to 1. This variable will keep track of the largest divisor we find.\n\n2. We then loop through all the numbers between 2 and `n-1` using a for loop.\n\n3. For each number `i`, we check if it divides `n` evenly using the modulus operator (`%`). If `n % i` equals 0, that means `i` is a divisor of `n`.\n\n4. If `i` is a divisor of `n`, we check if it's larger than the current value of `largest`. If it is, we update the value of `largest` to `i`.\n\n5. After the loop finishes, we return the value of `largest`.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function:\n\n```\nfunction largest_divisor(n) {\n  let largest = 1;\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0 && i > largest) {\n      largest = i;\n    }\n  }\n  return largest;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will loop through the numbers 2 to 14 and find that 3, 5, and 15 are divisors of 15. The largest divisor smaller than 15 is 5, so the function will return 5.",

Then, we loop through all the numbers from 1 to `n-1`, and if `n` is divisible by a number `i`, we add `i` to the `divisors` array.\n\nAfter all the divisors have been found, we sort the `divisors` array in descending order using the `sort()` method with a comparison function that sorts the array in descending order.

If the array contains an even number of elements, then the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\nHere's the function that would fulfill the prompt:\n\n```\nfunction median(l) {\n  // sort the array in ascending order\n  l.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a - b;\n  });\n\n  // find the middle index of the array\n  var middleIndex = Math.floor(l.length / 2);\n\n  // check if the array length is odd\n  if (l.length % 2 !== 0) {\n    // return the middle element\n    return l[middleIndex];\n  } else {\n    // return the average of the two middle elements\n    return (l[middleIndex - 1] + l[middleIndex]) / 2;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen this function is called with an array as an argument, it will sort the array in ascending order using the `sort()` method. It then identifies the middle index of the array and checks if the array length is odd or even. Depending on whether the array length is odd or even, it returns the value of the middle element or the average of the two middle elements respectively."

Finally, the function returns `max` as the maximum element in the list.\n\nFor example, calling `max_element([1, 2, 3])` will return `3` because `3` is the maximum element in the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

Since each car in the left-to-right set can collide with each car in the right-to-left set, the total number of pairs is `n * n`.\n- Next, we need to determine which pairs of cars actually collide. To do this, we note that the cars will collide if and only if their relative positions are such that the car moving left-to-right is ahead of the car moving right-to-left. Specifically, if car `i` in the left-to-right set has position `d_i` and car `j` in the right-to-left set has position `d_j`, then the cars will collide if and only if `d_i > d_j`.\n- We can therefore count the number of collisions by iterating through all possible pairs of cars and checking if their positions satisfy the collision condition. If they do, we increment a counter variable.\n\nHere's the full code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n):\n    # calculate total number of pairs of cars\n    num_pairs = n * n\n    \n    # count number of collisions\n    collisions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j and (i < j) != (i + j < n):\n                collisions += 1\n    \n    return collisions\n```\n\nNote that we exclude pairs of cars where `i == j`, since a car cannot collide with itself. We also use the expression `(i < j) != (i + j < n)` to check if the collision condition is satisfied. This expression evaluates to `True` if and only if `i < j` and `i + j >= n`, or if `i > j` and `i + j < n`. This is equivalent to the condition `d_i > d_j` that we derived earlier.",

We can initialize these lists to contain only zeros, since all cars start at the same position.\n\nThen, we can simulate the motion of the cars by repeatedly incrementing the position of each left-to-right car and decrementing the position of each right-to-left car. We can keep track of the number of collisions by counting the number of times that the position of a left-to-right car is equal to the position of a right-to-left car.\n\nHowever, since the cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving after colliding, we need to ensure that we do not count the same collision multiple times.

The cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving in their trajectory even after a collision. We need to write a function that takes an input parameter n (number of cars in each set) and returns the total number of collisions that occur.\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to use the concept of combinatorics. We know that each car in the left-to-right set will collide with exactly one car in the right-to-left set.

Therefore, we can increment the number of collisions by 1 for each pair of cars.\n\nHowever, we also need to count collisions for cars moving right to left. Since the road is infinitely long and the cars are moving at the same speed, the total number of collisions for each direction will be the same.

Since all cars move at the same speed, we can consider the left-to-right moving cars as stationary and the right-to-left moving cars as moving with a velocity of twice the speed of the cars. This means that the relative velocity of the two sets of cars is three times the speed of the cars.\n\nWe can then calculate the time it will take for the two sets of cars to collide.

The collision will occur when the distance between two points is minimized. \n\nIf we assume that the left-to-right cars are numbered from 1 to n, and the right-to-left cars are numbered from n+1 to 2n, we can calculate the positions of each car at time t using the formula `position = speed * time`. \n\nLet `d` be the distance between the first left-to-right car and the last right-to-left car at time t=0. The distance between the two sets of cars will decrease linearly with time, until it reaches 0 at time `t = d / (2 * speed)`.\n\nTo find the number of collisions, we need to count the number of pairs of cars that are at the same position at the same time. We can do this by using two nested loops: the outer loop iterates over the left-to-right cars, and the inner loop iterates over the right-to-left cars.

Since all cars are moving at the same speed, we can assume that they are all at different positions on the road at any given time. \n\nFor example, let's consider two cars A and B, with A moving left to right and B moving right to left. Let's assume that at a certain time t, A is at position x and B is at position y on the road, where x > y. If A and B collide at this point, then all cars to the left of A and all cars to the right of B will collide with each other as well.

We know that any two cars from opposite directions will collide if they are at the same point on the road at the same time.

It first calculates the times at which each pair of cars will meet using the formula above, and stores them in an array `times`. It then sorts the times in increasing order, and counts the number of collisions by counting the number of times that two cars from different sets meet at the same time. Finally, it returns the count of collisions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the cars are numbered from 1 to n in each set, and that they are moving at the same speed. If the speeds are different, we can modify the formula above to take this into account. If the cars are not numbered from 1 to n, we can use an array to store",
			"Here's one way to implement the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  // Each car has a starting position that's an integer between 1 and 1000.\n  const positions = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    positions.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1);\n  }\n\n  // We'll keep track of the number of collisions.\n  let collisions = 0;\n\n  // We'll simulate the movement of the cars.\n  while (true) {\n    // Move each car one unit to the right or left.\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      positions[i] += Math.random() < 0.5 ? -1 : 1;\n    }\n\n    // Check for collisions.\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n        if (i !== j && positions[i] === positions[j]) {\n          collisions++;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    // If all the cars have collided, we're done.\n    if (collisions === n * (n - 1)) {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Return the number of collisions.\n  return collisions;\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes an argument `n`, which is the number of cars driving in each direction. We start by generating random starting positions for each car between 1 and 1000.\n\nWe then enter a loop where we simulate the movement of the cars. At each iteration of the loop, we move each car one unit to the right or left (chosen randomly). We then check for collisions by comparing the positions of each pair of cars. If two cars have the same position, we count it as a collision.\n\nWe continue this loop until all the cars have collided with each other. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\nFinally, we return the total number of collisions that occurred during the simulation.",
			"Here is a possible implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  // Calculate the total number of possible collisions\n  const totalCollisions = n * (n - 1) / 2;\n  \n  // Return the total number of collisions\n  return totalCollisions;\n}\n```\n\nThe function takes in one parameter `n`, which represents the number of cars driving in each direction. The function first calculates the total number of possible collisions using the formula `n * (n - 1) / 2`, which is the number of combinations of two cars that can collide. Then, it returns the total number of collisions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all cars are evenly spaced out along the road and are traveling at the same speed. It also assumes that collisions only occur when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left, and not vice versa.",
			"Here's an implementation of the function `car_race_collision`:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  // The distance between the two sets of cars is 2n.\n  // Each collision will occur when the distance between two cars\n  // is equal to 2n. So we can count the number of such distances\n  // and return that as the number of collisions.\n  \n  const distance = 2 * n;\n  let collisions = 0;\n  \n  // We only need to check half of the distances (i.e., distances\n  // between left-moving cars and right-moving cars), since the other\n  // half will be counted when we check the right-moving cars against\n  // the left-moving cars.\n  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    const d = i * 2;\n    if (d <= distance) {\n      collisions++;\n    } else {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return collisions;\n}\n```\n\nThe function takes a single parameter `n`, which is the number of cars moving in each direction. It calculates the distance between the two sets of cars (which is `2n`) and then iterates over all possible distances between a left-moving car and a right-moving car. If the distance is less than or equal to `2n`, it counts it as a collision. If the distance is greater than `2n`, it breaks out of the loop (since all further distances will be greater than `2n`).\n\nFor example, if `n` is 3, there are 3 left-moving cars and 3 right-moving cars, and the distance between the two sets of cars is `2n = 6`. The possible distances between a left-moving car and a right-moving car are `2, 4, 6, 8, ...`. Since `2`, `4`, and `6` are all less than or equal to `6`, there are 3 collisions."

Once we have checked all the integers in the input array, we sort the \"result\" array in increasing order and return it.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```\nfunction unique_digits(x) {\n  let result = [];\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {\n    let hasEvenDigit = false;\n    let digits = x[i].toString().split(\"\");\n    \n    for (let j = 0; j < digits.length; j++) {\n      if (digits[j] % 2 === 0) {\n        hasEvenDigit = true;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    \n    if (!hasEvenDigit) {\n      result.push(x[i]);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  result.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a - b;\n  });\n  \n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the given examples:\n\n```\nconsole.log(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])); // [1, 15, 33]\nconsole.log(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])); // []\n```\n\nThe function returns the expected results.",
			"The function `unique_digits(x)` takes an array of positive integers as input and returns a sorted array of all elements that do not contain any even digits.\n\nTo achieve this, we first define an empty array called `result` that will hold our output. We then loop through each element of the input array `x`. For each element, we convert it into a string and check if any of its characters are even digits. If there are no even digits, we convert the string back into an integer and append it to the `result` array.\n\nFinally, we sort the `result` array in increasing order and return it as the output.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `unique_digits` function:\n\n```\nfunction unique_digits(x) {\n  const result = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {\n    const str = x[i].toString();\n    let hasEven = false;\n    for (let j = 0; j < str.length; j++) {\n      if (parseInt(str[j]) % 2 === 0) {\n        hasEven = true;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    if (!hasEven) {\n      result.push(parseInt(str));\n    }\n  }\n  result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nLet's test the function with the given examples:\n\n```\nconsole.log(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])); // [1, 15, 33]\nconsole.log(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])); // []\n``` \n\nThe first example returns `[1, 15, 33]` because only `1`, `15`, and `33` do not contain any even digits. The second example returns an empty array because all of the elements contain at least one even digit."
