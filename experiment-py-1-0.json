If `n` is even, there are two middle elements, so `mid` will be the index of the rightmost element of the left half of the list.\n4. If `n` is even, we return the average of the two middle elements. Otherwise, we return the middle element.\n\nYou can test this function using the examples in the docstring. For example:\n\n```python\nassert median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) == 3\nassert median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]) == 15.0\n```",

If `n` is even, the median is the average of the two middle values in the sorted list, which are `sorted(l)[n//2-1]` and `sorted(l)[n//2]`. If `n` is odd, the median is the middle value in the sorted list, which is `sorted(l)[n//2]`. The `//` operator is used to perform integer division (i.e., truncating the decimal part of the result).\n\nThe function returns a `float` value, even if the input list contains only integers. This is because the average of two integers may be a non-integer value (e.g., `3.5`).",

It then computes the median value of the sorted list. If the length of the list is even, it returns the average of the two middle values. If the length of the list is odd, it returns the middle value.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list contains only integers.
