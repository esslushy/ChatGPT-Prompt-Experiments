The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a sorted list. If there are an odd number of elements in the list, the median is the middle element.

It then checks if the length of the sorted list is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If the length is even, the function finds the middle two elements by dividing the length by two using integer division `//`. It then returns the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, the function finds the middle element and returns it directly. \n\nThe function handles both cases using conditional statements and returns the median as a float value as specified by the function signature. The function also includes a docstring with a brief description of its purpose and usage, as well as examples of expected inputs and outputs using the `doctest` module.",

The median is defined as the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n- First, we sort the input list `l` using Python's built-in `sorted` function. This ensures that the list is in ascending order.\n- Next, we determine the length of the sorted list using the `len` function and store it in the variable `n`.\n- We then check if the length of the list is even or odd by checking if `n` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is even, we return the average of the middle two values by using integer division `//` to calculate the index of the two middle values and then adding them together and dividing by 2. If `n` is odd, we simply return the middle value by using integer division to calculate the index of the middle value.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function can be used:\n\n```python\n>>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n3\n>>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])\n15.0\n>>> median([1, 2, 3, 4])\n2.5\n>>> median([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n3.5\n```",

It first sorts the list using the built-in `sorted` function. Then it checks if the length of the list is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If it's even, it takes the average of the two middle elements by indexing the list with `n // 2 - 1` and `n // 2`. If it's odd, it takes the middle element by indexing the list with `n // 2`.\n\nThe function is annotated with type hints to indicate that it takes a list of integers and returns a float. The docstring explains what the function does and gives examples of how to use it.",

If it's odd, we return the middle element.\n\nThe `//` operator is used for integer division, which returns the quotient without the remainder.\n\nHere are a few examples to illustrate how the function works:\n\n```\n>>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n3\n>>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])\n15.0\n>>> median([1, 2, 3, 4])\n2.5\n``` \n\nThe function works correctly for both even and odd length input lists.",

If the list has an even number of elements, the median value will be the average of the values at the middle index and the index before it.\n\nThe function returns the median value as a float. If the input list is empty, the function will raise an error because we cannot find a median value for an empty list.",

The median is the middle element of a sorted list. If the length of the list is even, then the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\nHere's how the implementation works:\n\n1. First, we find the length of the list `l` and assign it to the variable `n`.\n2. Then we sort the list using the `sorted()` function and assign it to the variable `s`.\n3. Next, we find the index of the middle element of the list using the floor division operator `//` and assign it to the variable `mid`.\n4. If the length of the list is even, we compute the average of the two middle elements and return it. Otherwise, we simply return the middle element.\n\nFor example, if we call the function with `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])`, the output will be `3` since the sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the middle element is `3`.\n\nSimilarly, if we call the function with `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])`, the output will be `15.0` since the sorted list is `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]` and the average of the two middle elements `10` and `20` is `15.0`.",

Otherwise, it returns the middle element.\n\nHere are some examples of how the `median` function works:\n\n```python\n>>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n3\n>>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])\n15.0\n>>> median([3, 1, 2, 4])\n2.5\n``` \n\nIn the first example, the list `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` is sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The length of the list is odd, so the function returns the middle element `3`.\n\nIn the second example, the list `[-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]` is sorted to `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]`. The length of the list is even, so the function returns the average of the two middle elements `(10 + 20) / 2 = 15.0`.\n\nIn the third example, the list `[3, 1, 2, 4]` is sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element of the sorted list.\n\nThe function uses the `len()` function to determine the length of the sorted list.

This value is then returned by the `max_element` function.\n\nThe function has type annotations for the input parameter `l` which is of type `List[int]` and the return value which is of type `int`. The function also includes a docstring that describes its purpose and provides examples of usage.",

To do this, it initializes a variable `max_val` to negative infinity, which ensures that the first element of the list will always be greater than `max_val`. The function then iterates through the list, comparing each element to the current maximum value `max_val`. If an element is greater than `max_val`, the function updates `max_val` to that element. Finally, the function returns `max_val`, which is guaranteed to be the maximum element in the list.\n\nThe function is tested with the doctest module, which compares the output of the function to the expected output in the documentation string. If the function returns the expected output for both test cases, then the function passes the tests.",

The function doesn't require any additional checks or processing, as the `max` function can handle empty lists and duplicate values.\n\nThe function has a type hint for `List[int]` as input and `int` as output, which indicates that it expects a list of integers and returns a single integer value. The function also includes a docstring that explains what the function does, how to use it, and provides examples of expected behavior.\n\nThe function can be called with different lists of integers, such as:\n\n```python\nprint(max_element([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3\nprint(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123\n```\n\nBoth calls should return the expected maximum value for each list.",

Similarly, if we call `max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])`, the function will return `123` because `123` is the largest element in the list.",

			"Here's a function that meets the prompt requirements:\n\n```python\ndef max_element(l: List[int]) -> int:\n    return max(l)\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as input and uses the built-in `max` function to return the largest element in the list. If the input list is empty, `max` will raise a `ValueError`, so make sure to handle that case if it's a possibility.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1.

			"\n\nThe prompt describes a scenario where n cars are moving from opposite directions on a straight, infinitely long road. The function needs to count the number of collisions that occur between the two sets of cars. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, they do not change their direction or speed after a collision.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a simple formula to calculate the total number of collisions. For n cars moving in opposite directions, there are n*(n-1)/2 possible collision pairs. This formula comes from the fact that each car moving in one direction can collide with every car moving in the opposite direction, except for itself.\n\nHere's the function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return int(n * (n-1) / 2)\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars moving in each direction. It then calculates the total number of possible collisions using the formula `n * (n-1) / 2` and returns the result as an integer.\n\nFor example, if there are 5 cars moving in each direction, the function would return 10, which represents the number of possible collision pairs.",
			"\n\nThe prompt requires us to count the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on a straight road. We can count the number of collisions by counting the number of pairs of cars that pass each other in opposite directions. Each pair of cars that passes each other without colliding corresponds to one collision.\n\nWe can solve this problem by computing the number of pairs of cars in both sets that pass each other without colliding. The number of such pairs is equal to the number of collisions.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # compute the number of pairs of cars in both sets\n    num_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    # the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs\n    return num_pairs\n```\n\nThe function takes an integer `n` as input, which is the number of cars in each set. It computes the total number of pairs of cars in both sets using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This formula computes the number of combinations of `n` items taken two at a time. We divide the result by two because we count each pair twice (once for the left-to-right set and once for the right-to-left set). Finally, we return the number of pairs as the number of collisions.\n\nFor example, if there are `n = 5` cars in each set, the function will compute `num_pairs = 10`. Therefore, there will be `10` collisions between the two sets of cars.",
			"\n\nThe prompt requires us to count the number of collisions that occur between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.

The function then initializes a variable `collisions` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the total number of collisions that occur.\n\nThe function then loops through each car in the first set (left to right). For each car, it calculates the distance between the two cars as `(n - i) * 2`. The variable `i` represents the index of the current car in the set, and the distance between the two cars is twice the remaining number of cars in the second set.\n\nIf the distance between the two cars is less than or equal to `n`, the two cars will collide, and the `collisions` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total number of collisions.",
			"\n\nThe prompt requires us to find the number of collisions between n cars moving in opposite directions on a straight road. Here's the implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n * (n - 1) // 2\n```\n\nThe above function uses a simple formula to calculate the number of collisions. It states that if we have `n` cars on the road moving in opposite directions, the total number of collisions will be equal to the combination of `n` taken two at a time, which is `(n * (n - 1)) / 2`.\n\nFor example, if there are 4 cars moving in opposite directions on the road, the total number of collisions will be `(4 * (4 - 1)) / 2`, which equals 6.\n\nSo, the `car_race_collision` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions that will occur when `n` cars are moving in opposite directions on a straight road.",
			"\n\nThe prompt describes a scenario where two sets of cars are moving towards each other on a straight road.

It also initializes a variable `collisions` to 0 to count the number of collisions.\n\nThe function then enters a loop that simulates the movement of the cars. In each iteration of the loop, the function checks for collisions between cars at the same position (i.e., with the same index in their respective boolean arrays). If there is a collision, the `collisions` counter is incremented.\n\nThe function then moves the cars one position to the right or left, depending on which half of the road they are on. This is done by setting the appropriate element of the boolean array to `False`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total number of collisions that occurred during the simulation.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all cars move at the same speed and that there are an equal number of left-moving and right-moving cars. It also assumes that the cars maintain their initial order and do not change lanes.",
			"\n\nThe problem statement describes a scenario where there are two sets of n cars moving towards each other on a straight road, and we need to count the number of collisions that occur. In this scenario, we can assume that all cars move at the same speed, and the collisions occur when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a brute-force approach. We can create two lists containing the positions of the left-moving cars and the right-moving cars, respectively. We can then iterate over each car in the left-moving list and check if there is any car in the right-moving list that is in its path. If we find a car in the right-moving list that is in the path of the left-moving car, we increment a counter.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]\n    right_cars = [i for i in range(n, 2*n)]\n    collisions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if left_cars[i] == right_cars[j]:\n                collisions += 1\n    return collisions\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first create two lists containing the positions of the left-moving and right-moving cars. We then initialize a counter for the number of collisions. We then iterate over each car in the left-moving list and check if there is any car in the right-moving list that is in its path. We do this by comparing the positions of the two cars. If we find a car in the right-moving list that is in the path of the left-moving car, we increment the collision counter. Finally, we return the number of collisions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the cars move at the same speed and that they cannot pass through each other. If the cars can pass through each other or if they move at different speeds, we would need a different approach to solve the problem.",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that the cars moving in the same direction will never collide. Also, we can observe that each car moving in one direction will eventually meet a car coming from the opposite direction. We can think of it as the leftward-moving cars overtaking the rightward-moving cars from behind.\n\nWe can solve this problem by using a math formula. Consider the first car moving leftward; it will meet n cars moving rightward before it overtakes the last car moving rightward. Similarly, the second car moving leftward will meet n-1 cars moving rightward before it overtakes the last car moving rightward. This pattern continues until the last car moving leftward that meets only one car moving rightward.\n\nThus, the total number of collisions will be the sum of the number of rightward-moving cars each leftward-moving car meets, which is n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1. This sum can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n*(n-1)//2\n```\n\nThe function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars moving in one direction. It returns the total number of collisions that will occur between cars moving in opposite directions.\n\nFor example, if there are 5 cars moving leftward and 5 cars moving rightward, the function will return 10, which is the total number of collisions.",
			"\n\nThe given prompt requires us to calculate the number of collisions that occur between cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. We can use the fact that all cars move at the same speed to calculate the time it takes for them to meet each other. Once we have the time, we can check if any two cars are at the same location at that time.\n\nHere is one possible implementation of the function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the time it takes for the cars to meet each other\n    time_to_meet = 1  # They are all moving at the same speed, so this value doesn't matter\n    \n    # Initialize a list to keep track of the positions of the left-to-right moving cars\n    positions = [i for i in range(n)]\n    \n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of collisions\n    collisions = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the right-to-left moving cars\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the position of the right-to-left moving car at the time they meet\n        position_at_meet = (n - i - 1) * time_to_meet\n        \n        # Check if any left-to-right moving cars are at the same position\n        for pos in positions:\n            if pos == position_at_meet:\n                collisions += 1\n        \n        # Remove the right-to-left moving car from the list of positions\n        positions.pop()\n    \n    # Return the number of collisions\n    return collisions\n```\n\nLet's go through the implementation step by step:\n\n1. We first calculate the time it takes for the cars to meet each other. Since all cars move at the same speed, this value can be any positive number.\n\n2. We initialize a list called `positions` to keep track of the positions of the left-to-right moving cars. Since they start at positions 0 to `n-1`, we can use a list comprehension to create this list.\n\n3. We initialize a variable called `collisions` to keep track of the number of collisions. This variable is initially set to 0.\n\n4. We loop through the right-to-left moving cars using a `for` loop. We use the loop variable `i` to calculate the position of the right-to-left moving car at the time they meet. Since they start at positions `n-1` to 0, we subtract `i` from `n-1` and multiply by the time it takes",
			"\n\nThe prompt defines a scenario where two sets of n cars are moving towards each other on an infinitely long road. They can collide and pass through each other as they are infinitely sturdy. The function should take an integer n as input and return the number of collisions that happen. \n\nHere is one way to write the function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # As the cars move at the same speed, they will meet exactly once in the middle of the road\n    # So the number of collisions is half the number of cars, rounded down\n    return n // 2\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.\n- Since the cars start very far away from each other and move towards each other at the same speed, they will meet exactly once in the middle of the road.\n- So the number of collisions is half the number of cars, rounded down. This is because the first car from the left will collide with the first car from the right, the second car from the left with the second from the right, and so on until the middle car(s).\n- To get the integer division, we use the `//` operator which returns the quotient after dividing the first operand by the second, rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\nExample usage:\n```\n>>> car_race_collision(4)\n2\n>>> car_race_collision(5)\n2\n>>> car_race_collision(6)\n3\n``` \n\nIn summary, the function calculates the number of collisions by dividing the number of cars by 2 and rounding down the result.",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions is equal to the number of cars in one direction multiplied by the number of cars in the other direction. Therefore, the solution is simply the product of the number of cars in each direction.\n\nWe can write a function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` (the number of cars in one direction) as input, and returns an integer (the total number of collisions). Here is the implementation:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n * n\n```\n\nThe function simply returns the product of `n` and `n`. This is because, as explained above, the total number of collisions is equal to the product of the number of cars in each direction.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 5, then there are 5 cars moving left to right, and 5 cars moving right to left. The total number of collisions is therefore 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nNote that the function assumes that all cars move at the same speed and that they start out being very far from each other. If these assumptions are not met, then the function may not give an accurate result.",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we can create two arrays that represent the position of the left-to-right cars and right-to-left cars. We can then sort these arrays to make it easier to compare the position of each car with the other set of cars. \n\nAfter sorting the arrays, we can iterate through the left-to-right array and for each car, we can search for the first car in the right-to-left array whose position is greater than or equal to the current car's position. The number of collisions is equal to the number of cars in the right-to-left array that are located to the left of this car.\n\nHere is the function that implements this algorithm:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]\n    right_cars = [i for i in range(n, 2*n)]\n    \n    collisions = 0\n    right_index = 0\n    for left_index in range(n):\n        while right_index < n and right_cars[right_index] < left_cars[left_index]:\n            right_index += 1\n        collisions += right_index\n        \n    return collisions\n```\n\nWe first create two arrays `left_cars` and `right_cars` that represent the positions of the left-to-right cars and right-to-left cars, respectively. We then initialize the `collisions` variable to zero and the `right_index` variable to zero.\n\nWe then loop through the `left_cars` array and for each car, we search for the first car in the `right_cars` array whose position is greater than or equal to the current car's position. We do this by iterating through the `right_cars` array using the `right_index` variable. If the position of the current car in the `right_cars` array is less than the position of the current car in the `left_cars` array, we increment the `right_index` variable until we find a car whose position is greater than or equal to the current car's position.\n\nOnce we have found the first car in the `right_cars` array whose position is greater than or equal to the current car's position, we add the number of cars that are located to the left of this car in the `right_cars` array to the `collisions` variable. Finally, we return the `collisions` variable.",
			"\n\nThe prompt asks us to find the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. The cars move with the same speed, and collisions occur when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving after the collision.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can first observe that the relative motion between the two cars can be considered as if they are moving towards each other with double the speed. So, we can assume that all the cars are moving towards each other with double the original speed.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the number of collisions between two sets of n cars moving towards each other on a straight road. We can represent the position of the cars as a list of integers, where the ith element represents the position of the ith car from the left. Similarly, we can represent the position of cars moving right to left as a list of integers, where the ith element represents the position of the ith car from the right.\n\nWe can sort both lists in ascending order, as the collision can only happen between cars that are closest to each other. We can then iterate over both lists simultaneously, and for each pair of cars, we can check if they collide or not. If they do, we can increment the collision counter and move to the next pair of cars. If they don't collide, we can move the car that is behind forward and repeat the process until all pairs of cars have been checked.\n\nOnce all the pairs have been checked, we can return the collision counter.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    left_cars = sorted(range(n))\n    right_cars = sorted(range(n), reverse=True)\n    i = j = collisions = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if left_cars[i] > right_cars[j]:\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            collisions += 1\n            i += 1\n    return collisions\n```\n\nWe first create two lists of integers representing the positions of cars moving left to right and right to left. We then initialize the collision counter and two pointers i and j to iterate over the two lists. We iterate until we reach the end of either list.\n\nFor each pair of cars, we check if the car moving left to right is ahead of the car moving right to left. If it is, we move the pointer for the right to",
			"\n\nThe prompt describes a scenario where there are two sets of cars, each with n number of cars, moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. The function should count the number of collisions that occur when a car moving from left to right hits a car moving from right to left.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinatorics. Suppose we number the cars from left to right and from right to left. Then, any two cars can collide only if their numbers add up to n+1. For example, car 1 moving left to right can collide with car n moving right to left, car 2 moving left to right can collide with car n-1 moving right to left, and so on.\n\nTherefore, we can loop through the numbers from 1 to n and count the number of pairs whose sum is n+1. The formula for the number of such pairs is n/2 (when n is even) or (n-1)/2 (when n is odd). This is because for every even n, there are n/2 pairs whose sum is n+1 (e.g., 1 and n, 2 and n-1, etc.), and for every odd n, there are (n-1)/2 pairs (e.g., 1 and n, 2 and n-1, etc.) plus one car that is not paired with any other car.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        # n is even\n        return int(n/2 * (n/2 + 1))\n    else:\n        # n is odd\n        return int((n-1)/2 * ((n-1)/2 + 1) + (n-1)/2 + 1)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first check if n is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). If n is even, we use the formula n/2 * (n/2 + 1) to calculate the number of collisions. If n is odd, we use the formula (n-1)/2 * ((n-1)/2 + 1) + (n-1)/2 + 1, which adds one more collision for the unpaired car. The int() function is used to convert the result to an integer.",

The cars move in a straight line and have the same speed. The function `car_race_collision(n: int) -> int` takes an integer parameter `n` and returns an integer representing the number of collisions.\n\nHere's the function implementation:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # The number of collisions equals the number of pairs of cars moving towards each other\n    # We can calculate this by computing the number of pairs (n choose 2) and multiplying it by 2\n    # since each pair can result in a collision from either direction\n    return n * (n - 1)\n```\n\nThe function calculates the number of pairs of cars moving towards each other by computing `(n choose 2)` which is equivalent to `n * (n-1) / 2`. Multiplying this by 2 gives us the total number of possible collisions. We can simplify this to `n * (n-1)` as we are only interested in the number of collisions and not the number of pairs.\n\nFor example, if we call `car_race_collision(3)`, the function returns 6 since there are 3 pairs of cars moving towards each other, and each pair can result in a collision from either direction.",

The function then computes the number of collisions as `n // 2`, which is the integer division of `n` by 2. This works because each left-moving car will collide with exactly one right-moving car, so we can count the number of left-moving cars and divide by 2 to get the number of collisions.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 10, then there are 5 left-moving cars and 5 right-moving cars, so the function will return `5 // 2 = 2` collisions.",

Moreover, since all cars are moving at the same speed, each car will only collide with a car that is at the same distance from it but moving in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, we can consider the `n` cars moving in one direction to be at positions `0, 1, 2, ..., n-1`, while the `n` cars moving in the opposite direction are at positions `n, n+1, n+2, ..., 2n-1`. The time it takes for two cars at positions `i` and `j` to collide is simply the absolute difference between their positions, which is `abs(j - i)`.\n\nWe can loop through all pairs of cars and count the number of collisions by checking if their collision time is less than infinity.

We can then simulate the movement of the cars and check if any two cars collide. Two cars collide if and only if the sum of their positions is equal to the same constant value `k` for all time steps, where `k` is the total number of cars on the road.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    k = 2*n\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(n+1, k+1):\n            if (i+j) == k:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe function starts by initializing `k` to `2*n`, which is the total number of cars on the road.

We can also assume that the cars are numbered from 1 to n, with the i-th car moving left to right and the i-th car moving right to left being a pair. \n\nWhen the cars start moving, they will eventually collide with each other.

To accomplish this, the function first checks if the string is empty. If so, it returns `False`.\n\nNext, it gets the last character of the string using slicing (`txt[-1]`).\n\nThen, the function checks if the last character is alphabetical and not part of a word. This is done using the `isalpha()` method to check if the last character is alphabetical and a conditional statement to check if the last word in the string is only one word or if the last character is the last character of the last word.\n\nFinally, if the last character is not alphabetical or is part of a word, the function returns `False`.",

If it is, we return False, as the last character cannot be an alphabetical character that is not part of a word.\n\nNext, we check if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. To check if it is not part of a word, we split the string into a list of words using `split()`. If the length of this list is 1, then the last character is not part of a word (as there is only one word in the string). If the length of the list is greater than 1, then we check if the last character is the last character of the last word in the string.

If `n` is less than 2, the function immediately returns `False`.\n\nIf `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function then iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is because any factor of `n` greater than the square root of `n` must also have a corresponding factor less than the square root of `n`.\n\nIf the input `n` is divisible by any number within this range, then it is not prime, and the function returns `False`.

The reason for this range is that if a number n is not a prime, it can be factored into two factors a and b such that n = a * b. If both a and b were greater than the square root of n, then a * b would be greater than n. So at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of n.\n\nInside the loop, it checks if the input number n is divisible by the current loop index i, if it is, then n is not a prime, and the function returns False.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any factors of n, then the input number n is a prime, and the function returns True.\n\nThe function returns True for all prime numbers including 2, which is the only even prime number.",
			"\n\nThe provided function prompt asks to write a function `is_prime(n: int) -> bool` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value `True` if the given number is prime, and `False` otherwise. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Check if the given number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, return `False` as 1 and all numbers less than 1 are not prime. \n\n2. Check if the given number `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If it is, return `False` as the number is not prime. If it is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`, it is prime, and we return `True`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `is_prime` function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n))+1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first import the `math` library to use the `sqrt` function. We then define the `is_prime` function that takes an integer `n` as input.\n\nIn the function, we first check if the number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we immediately return `False` because 1 and all numbers less than 1 are not prime.\n\nNext, we loop through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and check if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is, we immediately return `False` because the number is not prime. If we have looped through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and `n` is not divisible by any of them, we return `True` because the number is prime.\n\nFinally, we have included some doctests in the function's docstring to test the function's correctness. We can run these doctests using a testing framework like `pytest` to check if the function is working as expected.",

If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime by definition.

If none of the numbers in the loop divide `n`, then `n` is prime and the function returns `True`.\n\nThe function is tested using the `doctest` module which provides a way to test functions by including example inputs and expected outputs in the function's docstring.",
			"\n\nThe `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a boolean value. It checks if the number `n` is a prime number or not. \n\nA prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. \n\nTo check if `n` is a prime number, the function will iterate through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and check if any of these numbers are divisors of `n`.

If it is, the function returns False because any number less than or equal to 1 is not a prime number.\n\nThe for loop iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The reason for this is that any factor of `n` greater than the square root of `n` must also have a factor less than the square root of `n`. Therefore, we only need to check factors up to the square root of `n` to determine if `n` is a prime number.\n\nWithin the for loop, we check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is a factor of `n` and `n` is not a prime number. In this case, we return False.\n\nIf no factors are found, the function returns True because `n` is a prime number.",

This is done by first converting the integer to a string using `str(num)` and then checking if any of the digits in the string are even by using the `any` function.\n\nIf none of the digits are even, the integer is added to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sorted `result` list.\n\nThe function can be called like this:\n\n```python\nprint(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1]))  # Output: [1, 15, 33]\nprint(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10]))  # Output: []\n```",

Finally, we sort the `result` list in increasing order and return it.\n\nNote that we use the `all` function to check if all the digits in `digits` are odd.

Finally, the result list is sorted in increasing order and returned.\n\nTo check if every digit in a number is odd, we convert the number to a string using `str(num)` and iterate over each character using a generator expression.

Finally, the function returns a sorted version of the `result` list.\n\nFor example, if we call `unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])`, the function will iterate over the list `[15, 33, 1422, 1]`. It will first check the integer `15` and find that both of its digits are odd. Therefore, it will append `15` to the `result` list. Next, it will check the integer `33` and find that both of its digits are also odd. Therefore, it will append `33` to the `result` list. Then, it will check the integer `1422` and find that one of its digits is even. Therefore, it will skip this integer and move on to the next. Finally, it will check the integer `1` and find that its only digit is odd. Therefore, it will append `1` to the `result` list.

First, we define an empty list `result` to store the integers that meet the condition. Then, we loop through each number in the input list `x`. For each number, we set a boolean `even_digit` to `False`. We then loop through the digits of the number as strings using `for digit in str(num)`. If any digit is even (i.e., if `int(digit) % 2 == 0`), we set `even_digit` to `True` and break the loop. If there are no even digits in the number, we append it to our `result` list. Finally, we sort the `result` list and return it.\n\nWe can test the function with the sample inputs provided in the prompt:\n\n```python\n>>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])\n[1, 15, 33]\n\n>>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])\n[]\n```",
