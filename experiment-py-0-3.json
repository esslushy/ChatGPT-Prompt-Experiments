The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the operators, and an `if` statement to select the appropriate operation based on the operator string.

For each operator, we add it to the expression string along with the next operand in the operands list.\n- Finally, we use the `eval()` function to evaluate the expression and return the result.\n\nNote that we use the `str()` function to convert the operands to strings before adding them to the expression. This is necessary because we cannot concatenate strings with integers directly.\n\nAlso, be aware that using `eval()` can be dangerous if the input is not properly sanitized, as it allows for arbitrary code execution. In this case, since the input is coming from a trusted source (the function arguments), it should be safe to use `eval()`."

We then iterate through the list, and for each element, we compare it with `max_val`.

This formula works by counting the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars traveling in each direction, the total number of pairs of cars is `n * (n - 1)`. However, each pair of cars is counted twice (once for each direction), so we need to divide the total by 2 to get the final answer.",

We assume that the cars are initially spaced out evenly on the road.\n- We initialize a variable `collisions` to zero, which will keep track of the number of collisions that occur.\n- We simulate the cars' movements until they all pass each other. We do this by repeatedly moving the leftmost car on the left side and the rightmost car on the right side, until they either collide or pass each other without colliding.\n- If the leftmost car on the left side has a smaller position than the rightmost car on the right side, then it hasn't caught up to the rightmost car yet, so we move it one step to the right. Similarly, if the leftmost car on the left side has a larger position than the rightmost car on the right side, then it has already passed the rightmost car, so we move the rightmost car one step to the left.\n- If the leftmost car on the left side has the same position as the rightmost car on the right side, then a collision occurs.

Then it loops through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number (inclusive), checking if any of them divide the number without leaving a remainder.

The function first checks if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is 1 or less, it's not considered a prime number, so the function returns `False`.\n\n2. If `n` is greater than 1, the function checks if it's divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not a prime number, so the function returns `False`.\n\n3. If the function doesn't find any factor of `n` between 2 and the square root of `n`, it means that `n` is a prime number. In this case, the function returns `True`.\n\nBy using this implementation, you can run the test cases provided in the prompt and check if the function works correctly.",

Then, it uses a for loop to check if the input is divisible by any number from 2 up to (and including) the square root of the input. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not a prime number and the function returns False. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it must be a prime number and the function returns True.",
			"Sure! Here's one way to complete the `is_prime` function:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.\"\"\"\n    if n < 2:  # 0 and 1 are not prime\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the input `n` is less than 2. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`, since 0 and 1 are not considered prime numbers.\n\nIf `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function enters a loop that checks whether `n` is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive). If `n` is found to be divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`.\n\nNote that we only need to check divisors up to the square root of `n`. This is because if `n` has a divisor larger than its square root, then it must also have a corresponding divisor that is smaller than its square root. For example, if `n` is divisible by 10, then it must also be divisible by 2 or 5. By only checking divisors up to the square root of `n`, we can reduce the number of iterations required in the loop, which can be a significant optimization for large values of `n`.",

It then checks if the current character of both strings are equal or not. If they are equal, it appends a '0' to the result string, otherwise, it appends a '1'.

It iterates over each element of the strings and checks if they are equal or not. If they are equal, then it adds '0' to the result string, otherwise it adds '1'. Finally, it returns the result string.\n\nFor example, if we call `string_xor('010', '110')`, the function will iterate over each element of `a` and `b` and compare them. The first element of `a` is '0' and the first element of `b` is '1', so it adds '1' to the result string. The second element of `a` is '1' and the second element of `b` is '1', so it adds '0' to the result string. The third element of `a` is '0' and the third element of `b` is '0', so it adds '0' to the result string. Thus, the result string is '100', which is returned by the function."
