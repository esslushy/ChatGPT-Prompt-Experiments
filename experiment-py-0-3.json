			"There are different ways to implement the median function, but one common approach is to sort the list and return the middle element or the average of the middle two elements if the list has an even length. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```\ndef median(l: List[int]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Return median of elements in the list l.\"\"\"\n    n = len(l)\n    sorted_l = sorted(l)\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        # list has odd length, return middle element\n        return sorted_l[n // 2]\n    else:\n        # list has even length, return average of middle two elements\n        i = n // 2\n        return (sorted_l[i - 1] + sorted_l[i]) / 2\n```\n\nThis implementation first checks if the length of the list is odd or even by checking if the remainder of dividing the length by 2 is 1 or 0, respectively. If the list is odd, the middle element is returned by indexing the sorted list with `n // 2`, which performs integer division to get the floor of the middle index. If the list is even, the middle two elements are averaged by indexing the sorted list with `i - 1` and `i`, where `i` is the integer division of `n` by 2. The result is returned as a float.",
			"Here is the implementation of the `median` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef median(l: List[int]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Return median of elements in the list l.\"\"\"\n    sorted_list = sorted(l)\n    n = len(sorted_list)\n    mid = n // 2\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return (sorted_list[mid - 1] + sorted_list[mid]) / 2\n    else:\n        return sorted_list[mid]\n```\n\nThe function takes a list of integers `l` and returns the median value as a float. The median is calculated by first sorting the list using the `sorted` function, then finding the middle index `mid` based on the length `n` of the sorted list. If the length is even, the median is the average of the middle two elements. If the length is odd, the median is the middle element.",

This is a well-known formula to calculate the number of combinations of `n` items taken `2` at a time.\n- For each pair of cars, there will be a collision if their distance is divisible by 2. This is because the cars are moving in opposite directions at the same speed, so they will collide at the midpoint of their journey. Since the distance is infinite, we can assume that this midpoint exists and is exactly `distance / 2` units away from each car's starting point.\n- Therefore, the total number of collisions is simply the number of pairs of cars multiplied by the probability of a collision, which is 1/2.",

We start by creating two sequences of car positions: one for the left-to-right cars and one for the right-to-left cars. We can then iterate over these sequences in parallel using the `zip` function, which pairs up corresponding elements from each sequence. We compare the positions of the two cars at each step, and if the left-to-right car has overtaken the right-to-left car (i.e. its position is greater than or equal to the other car's position), we count it as a collision. If there is no collision at a given step, we can stop the iteration because all subsequent steps will also not result in a collision. Finally, we return the total number of collisions detected.",

However, since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong and continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide, we don't actually need to simulate the collisions. All we need to do is count the number of pairs where a left-moving car is to the right of a right-moving car.",

			"\n\nHere's one possible implementation:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the total number of collisions between the two sets of cars\n    # We'll count the number of collisions for each car moving left to right\n    # by comparing its position to the positions of all cars moving right to left\n    # that are to the left of it\n    total_collisions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the position of the car moving left to right at time t\n        position = i + 1\n        # Check how many cars moving right to left are to the left of it\n        collisions = min(i, n - i - 1)\n        # Add the number of collisions to the total count\n        total_collisions += collisions\n    return total_collisions\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe can simulate the movement of the cars by thinking about their positions at different times. At time t, a car moving left to right will be at position i + t, where i is its initial position. Similarly, a car moving right to left will be at position n - i - t. If these positions are equal, the two cars will collide.\n\nWe want to count the number of collisions between the two sets of cars. To do this, we can iterate over all cars moving left to right and count how many cars moving right to left are to the left of them. We only need to consider cars that are to the left of them, since cars to the right will not collide with them.\n\nThe number of cars moving right to left to the left of a car moving left to right is equal to the car's initial position i. However, we also need to make sure that we don't count collisions with cars that are too far to the left (i.e. with negative positions). The furthest left a car moving left to right can collide with a car moving right to left is when the car moving left to right is at position 1 and the car moving right to left is at position n - 1. In this case, the two cars will collide at time t = n - 1. Therefore, we only need to count collisions up to min(i, n - i - 1).\n\nFinally, we add up the number of collisions for each car moving left to right to get the total number of collisions.",

It then loops through all the cars moving left to right and calculates the time for each car to reach the origin. Using this time, it calculates the position of the car at that time.\n\nNext, it loops through all the cars moving right to left and does the same calculations to find the position of each car at the time it reaches the origin. It then checks if any two cars collide by comparing their positions. If two cars collide, it increments the number of collisions.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total number of collisions.",
