			"The function `largest_divisor(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as its argument and returns the largest integer that evenly divides `n` and is smaller than `n`.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We start by initializing a variable `largest_div` to be equal to zero. This variable will keep track of the largest divisor we have found so far.\n2. We then loop through all the integers from 1 to `n-1`.\n3. For each integer `i` in the loop, we check if `n` is evenly divisible by `i`. If it is, we check if `i` is greater than `largest_div`. If it is, we set `largest_div` to be equal to `i`.\n4. Once the loop is finished, we return the value of `largest_div`.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```\nfunction largest_divisor(n) {\n  let largest_div = 0;\n  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0 && i > largest_div) {\n      largest_div = i;\n    }\n  }\n  return largest_div;\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will loop through the integers 1 to 14 and find that 3, 5, and 15 are the only divisors of 15. The largest divisor that is smaller than 15 is 5, so the function will return 5.",
			"To find the largest number that divides n evenly and is smaller than n, we can start by checking if n is divisible by any number less than n. We can do this by iterating over all numbers from 1 to n-1 and checking if n is divisible by that number using the modulo operator. If it is divisible, then we update a variable to keep track of the largest divisor found so far. Once we have checked all numbers less than n, we return the largest divisor found.\n\nHere's the code for the `largest_divisor` function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction largest_divisor(n) {\n  let largestDivisor = 1;\n  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) {\n      largestDivisor = i;\n    }\n  }\n  return largestDivisor;\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we initialize the `largestDivisor` variable to 1, since 1 is always a divisor of any number. Then, we start iterating over all numbers from 2 to n-1 using a for loop. For each number i, we check if n is divisible by i using the modulo operator (`n % i === 0`). If it is divisible, we update the `largestDivisor` variable to i. This way, we keep track of the largest divisor found so far. Once we have checked all numbers less than n, we return the `largestDivisor`. \n\nWhen we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will iterate over the numbers 2 to 14, and find that 15 is divisible by 3 and 5. Since 5 is the larger of the two, it will return 5.",
			"The function `largest_divisor()` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`. \n\nTo find the largest divisor of `n`, we can start checking from the largest possible divisor, which is `n/2`. We will then check if `n` is divisible by this number. If yes, then this number is the largest divisor, and we return it. If not, we check the next smaller number and repeat the process until we find a divisor or reach 1. \n\nHere's the code:\n\n```\nfunction largest_divisor(n) {\n  for (let i = Math.floor(n/2); i > 0; i--) {\n    if (n % i === 0) {\n      return i;\n    }\n  }\n  return 1;\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, we use a `for` loop to iterate through all the possible divisors of `n`. We start from `Math.floor(n/2)` because any divisor larger than this will not be smaller than `n`. \n\nInside the loop, we use the modulus operator `%` to check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If yes, we return `i` as the largest divisor. If we don't find any divisor in the loop, then `1` is the largest divisor. \n\nSo, when we call `largest_divisor(15)`, it will return `5`.",
			"The function `largest_divisor()` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`. \n\nTo find the largest divisor, the function first creates a list of all divisors of `n` using a loop. Starting from `1`, the function checks all numbers up to `n-1` to see if they divide `n` evenly. If a number is a divisor, it is added to the list of divisors.\n\nOnce the list of divisors is created, the function sorts the list in descending order and returns the first element of the sorted list. This is the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```\nfunction largest_divisor(n){\n  let divisors = [];\n  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++){\n    if (n % i === 0){\n      divisors.push(i);\n    }\n  }\n  divisors.sort(function(a, b){return b-a});\n  return divisors[0];\n}\n```\n\nFor example, `largest_divisor(15)` returns `5`, because the divisors of `15` are `1, 3, 5,` and `15`, and `5` is the largest divisor that is smaller than `15`.",

Once the loop completes, the function returns the value stored in `largest_divisor`.\n\nFor example, if we call the function `largest_divisor(15)`, it will return `5` because `5` is the largest divisor of `15` that is smaller than `15`.",

This comparison function determines the order in which the elements are sorted. In this case, we're using a simple function that subtracts the second number from the first. If the result is negative, it means that the first number should come before the second in the sorted array, so the `sort()` function will swap their positions. If the result is positive, it means that the second number should come before the first, so they'll stay in their current positions. If the result is zero, they'll also stay in their current positions.\n2. Then, we check if the length of the array is odd or even.

If the length is even, we need to return the average of the two middle elements. We calculate these elements by taking the one at the index `(l.length / 2) - 1` (which is the left-hand middle element) and the one at the index `l.length / 2` (which is the right-hand middle element).

For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4], the median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `median` function that follows the above approach:\n\n```\nfunction median(l){\n  // First we sort the list\n  l.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});\n\n  // Find the middle index\n  var middleIndex = Math.floor(l.length / 2);\n\n  // If the length of the list is odd, return the middle element\n  if (l.length % 2 !== 0) {\n    return l[middleIndex];\n  }\n\n  // If the length of the list is even, return the average of the two middle elements\n  return (l[middleIndex - 1] + l[middleIndex]) / 2;\n}\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the list using the `sort` method. We pass a function to `sort` that subtracts the second element from the first to determine the correct order for the elements.\n\nNext, we find the middle index of the sorted list by dividing the length of the list by 2 and rounding down using `Math.floor`.\n\nFinally, we check if the length of the list is odd or even, and return the median accordingly. If the length of the list is odd, we return the middle element. If it's even, we return the average of the two middle elements.",
			"\n\nThe median of a list is the middle value when the list is sorted. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the middle two elements.\n\nHere is one possible implementation of the median function:\n\n```\nfunction median(l) {\n  l.sort(function(a, b) { return a - b; });\n  var middle = Math.floor(l.length / 2);\n  if (l.length % 2 === 0) {\n    return (l[middle - 1] + l[middle]) / 2.0;\n  } else {\n    return l[middle];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe function first sorts the input array in ascending order using the built-in `sort` method with a comparison function. \n\nThen, it calculates the middle index of the sorted array using the `Math.floor` function to round down the result of dividing the array length by 2. \n\nIf the array length is even, the function returns the average of the values at the middle index and the index before it. \n\nIf the array length is odd, the function simply returns the value at the middle index.\n\nFor example, `median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` first sorts the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then returns the value at index 2, which is 3.\n\nSimilarly, `median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])` sorts the array to `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]`, then returns the average of the values at index 2 and 3, which is 15.0."

			"Here's a possible implementation of the `do_algebra` function:\n\n```\nfunction do_algebra(operator, operand) {\n  let result = operand[0];\n  for (let i = 0; i < operator.length; i++) {\n    const op = operator[i];\n    const nextOperand = operand[i+1];\n    switch (op) {\n      case '+':\n        result += nextOperand;\n        break;\n      case '-':\n        result -= nextOperand;\n        break;\n      case '*':\n        result *= nextOperand;\n        break;\n      case '//':\n        result = Math.floor(result / nextOperand);\n        break;\n      case '**':\n        result **= nextOperand;\n        break;\n      default:\n        throw new Error(`Unsupported operator: ${op}`);\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\nThe function takes two arrays as parameters: `operator` and `operand`. \n\nThe `result` variable is initialized to the first operand in the `operand` array. The function then loops through the `operator` array, and for each operator, applies it to the `result` variable and the next operand in the `operand` array. The switch statement handles the different operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, floor division, and exponentiation. If an operator not supported by the function is encountered, an error is thrown.\n\nFinally, the function returns the resulting value of the algebraic expression.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input arrays are valid (i.e., the length of `operator` is one less than the length of `operand`, `operand` contains non-negative integers, and `operator` contains only valid operators). It does not perform any input validation, so you may want to add that to your implementation if necessary.",

We then loop through the `operator` array and apply each operator to the `expression` variable along with the corresponding value from the `operand` array.\n\nThe `switch` statement inside the loop matches each operator to its corresponding operation. For example, if the operator is `+`, we add the next value in the `operand` array to the `expression` variable. We continue to do this for each operator until we've gone through the entire `operator` array.\n\nFinally, we return the `expression` variable, which now holds the evaluated result of the algebraic expression.\n\nNote that we also have a `default` case in the `switch` statement in case an invalid operator is passed in.

			"\n\nThe `do_algebra` function takes two arrays as input: `operator` and `operand`. The `operator` array contains basic algebra operations, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, and `**`. The `operand` array contains non-negative integers, which will be used to build the algebraic expression.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `result` to the first element of the `operand` array. Then, it loops through each operator in the `operator` array and applies the corresponding operation to `result` and the next element in the `operand` array. The new value of `result` is then used in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nOnce all operations have been applied, the final value of `result` is returned.

We loop through the `operator` array and concatenate each operator and its corresponding operand to the `expr` variable, with spaces in between.\n3. Finally, we use the `eval()` function to evaluate the expression and return the result.\n\nNote that the `eval()` function is not recommended for use in production code, as it can execute arbitrary code and pose security risks.

If the operator is `//`, it performs floor division by dividing the expression by the next number in the `operand` array and using the `Math.floor` function to round down to the nearest integer.

			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and computes the number of collisions that occur when `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left collide. \n\nTo compute the number of collisions, we can consider the fact that if there are `n` cars moving in each direction, then there are `n*n` pairs of cars that could potentially collide. \n\nHowever, we can simplify this computation by noting that each pair of cars will collide if and only if they are at the same position at the same time. Since all cars are moving at the same speed, we can compute the time it takes for each pair of cars to meet at the midpoint of the road (i.e., the point where the left-to-right and right-to-left cars are closest to each other). \n\nOnce we have computed the time it takes for each pair of cars to meet at the midpoint of the road, we can sort these times and count the number of pairs of cars that meet at each time. The number of collisions is then equal to the sum of the number of pairs of cars that meet at each time greater than zero.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n):\n    # Compute the midpoint of the road\n    midpoint = 0.5\n    \n    # Compute the time it takes for each pair of cars to meet at the midpoint\n    times = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        time = midpoint / (i+1)\n        times.append(time)\n    \n    # Sort the times and count the number of pairs of cars that meet at each time\n    collisions = 0\n    for time in sorted(times):\n        count = times.count(time)\n        collisions += count*(count-1)//2\n    \n    return collisions\n```\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. We start by computing the midpoint of the road, which is equal to 0.5 (since the road is infinitely long, we can use any unit of distance we like).\n\n2. We then loop over each pair of cars and compute the time it takes for them to meet at the midpoint of the road. We do this by dividing the distance to the midpoint (which is equal to `midpoint`) by the speed of the car moving left to right. Since each car is moving at the same speed, the time it takes for each pair of cars to meet is simply the distance to the midpoint divided by the speed of the left-to-right",

We start by creating two lists `left_to_right_cars` and `right_to_left_cars` that represent the initial positions of the cars. Each car is assigned a unique position based on its index, starting from 0 for the left-to-right cars and n for the right-to-left cars.\n\n2. We calculate the time it would take for the closest pair of cars to collide. To do this, we iterate over the positions of the left-to-right cars and calculate the distance to the closest right-to-left car. We subtract the position of the left-to-right car from the position of the right-to-left car and subtract 1 (since the two cars are moving towards each other). We take the minimum of these distances as the time it would take for the closest pair of cars to collide.\n\n3. We iterate over the positions of the left-to-right cars again and count how many of them would collide with a right-to-left car at the calculated time. We do this by checking if the position of the left-to-right car plus the time to collision is in the list of right-to-left cars. We use a generator expression with the `sum` function to count the number of collisions.\n\n4. We return the number of collisions.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all cars are moving at the same speed and that collisions can only happen between cars moving towards each other. It also assumes that the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong and continue moving after a collision as if nothing happened.",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative velocity. Since all cars are moving at the same speed, we can consider one set of cars as stationary and the other set of cars moving towards them with twice the speed (since they are moving in opposite directions). \n\nLet's assume that the stationary set of cars is the one moving from left to right. For each car in this set, we can calculate the distance it needs to cover before colliding with a car in the other set. This distance can be calculated as the distance between the two sets of cars divided by the number of cars in each set. \n\nOnce we have the distance to collision for each car, we can sort them in ascending order and count the number of pairs that collide, using a two-pointer approach. \n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  const distanceToCollision = 1 / (2 * n);\n  const leftToRightCars = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i * distanceToCollision);\n  const rightToLeftCars = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i * distanceToCollision);\n  \n  leftToRightCars.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  rightToLeftCars.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n  \n  let leftIndex = 0;\n  let rightIndex = 0;\n  let collisions = 0;\n  \n  while (leftIndex < n && rightIndex < n) {\n    if (leftToRightCars[leftIndex] + distanceToCollision >= rightToLeftCars[rightIndex]) {\n      collisions++;\n      rightIndex++;\n    } else {\n      leftIndex++;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return collisions;\n}\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We calculate the distance to collision using the formula we derived earlier and initialize arrays for both sets of cars, with each car's position calculated as its index times the distance to collision.\n\n2. We sort both arrays in ascending order.\n\n3. We use a two-pointer approach to count the number of collisions. We initialize the left pointer to 0 and the right pointer to 0. We iterate over both arrays and check if the distance between the left-to-right car and the right-to-left car is less than or equal to the distance to collision. If it is, we increment the collision counter and move the right pointer to the next car. If not, we move the left pointer to the next car.\n\n4.",

We initialize the positions to `Infinity` for the left-to-right cars and `0` for the right-to-left cars, since they start very far from each other. We use the `Array.from` method with a callback function to create this array.\n- We then initialize a `collisions` counter variable to `0`.\n- Next, we sort the array of cars by their position, so we can iterate over them in order from left to right. We use the `Array.prototype.sort` method with a comparison function to achieve this.\n- For each car, we find all the cars moving in the opposite direction that have already passed it (i.e., whose position is less than the current car's position), using the `Array.prototype.filter` method.\n- We then check if at least one of those colliding cars has a position greater than the current car's position, indicating a collision. We use the `Array.prototype.some` method for this.\n- If a collision occurs, we increment the `collisions` counter.\n- Finally, we return the total number of collisions.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all cars have the same speed and that they move continuously without stopping or changing direction.

It first creates two lists of length `n`, one for the left-to-right cars and one for the right-to-left cars. Each car is represented by its position along the road, which is a real number. The left-to-right cars are assigned positions `1` to `n`, while the right-to-left cars are assigned positions `-1` to `-n`.\n\nThe function then initializes two pointers, one for the left cars and one for the right cars, both pointing to the first car in their respective lists. It also initializes a counter for the number of collisions.\n\nThe function then enters a loop",
			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as input which represents the number of cars driving left to right and the number of cars driving right to left. The function calculates the number of collisions that will occur between the two sets of cars assuming they are moving at the same speed.\n\nTo calculate the number of collisions, we first need to find out the distance between the two sets of cars. Since the road is infinitely long, we can assume that the distance between the two sets of cars is also infinite. However, for the purpose of this function, we can assume that the distance between the two sets of cars is `d`.\n\nSince all cars are moving at the same speed, we can assume that each car is moving at a constant velocity `v`. Therefore, the time it takes for two cars to collide once they are within `d` distance of each other is `t = d/v`. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many pairs of cars will be within `d` distance of each other at any given time. This can be calculated using the combination formula `C(n, 2)` which gives us the number of ways to choose 2 cars from `n` cars.\n\nTherefore, the total number of collisions that will occur is `C(n, 2) * t`. \n\nWe can implement this function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n):\n    d = float('inf') # distance between the two sets of cars\n    v = 1 # speed of each car\n    t = d/v # time it takes for two cars to collide\n    num_collisions = int((n*(n-1)/2) * t) # calculate number of collisions using combination formula\n    return num_collisions\n```\n\nNote: We assume that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, since we need at least 2 cars to collide.",
			"Here's a possible implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n):\n    # Each car has a unique position\n    left_cars = list(range(n))\n    right_cars = list(range(n, 2*n))\n    # We'll count the number of collisions\n    num_collisions = 0\n    # Simulate the movement of the cars\n    for i in range(n):\n        # The distance between the two cars\n        distance = right_cars[i] - left_cars[i]\n        # If the distance is negative, they have collided\n        if distance <= 0:\n            num_collisions += 1\n    # Return the total number of collisions\n    return num_collisions\n```\n\nThe `car_race_collision` function takes a single argument `n`, which represents the number of cars driving in each direction. The function creates two lists, `left_cars` and `right_cars`, which represent the initial positions of the cars on each side of the road. The positions are represented as integers, with the leftmost car having position 0 and the rightmost car having position `2*n-1`.\n\nThe function then simulates the movement of the cars by iterating over each car in the left-to-right direction. For each car, it calculates the distance to the corresponding car moving in the opposite direction. If the distance is negative, it means the two cars have collided, so the function increments the `num_collisions` counter.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total number of collisions that occurred during the simulation.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all cars move at the same speed and that there are no other obstacles on the road that could cause collisions. Also, the function assumes that the cars are point objects that collide when their positions overlap, rather than having physical dimensions that could cause them to block each other's movement.",
			"Here's a function that can calculate the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long road:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n) {\n  // We'll use a simple formula to calculate the number of collisions:\n  // (n choose 2) * 2, since there are n cars moving in each direction and each pair can collide in either direction.\n  return (n * (n - 1)) * 2;\n}\n```\n\nIn the function, we first calculate the total number of cars by multiplying n (the number of cars in each direction) by 2. Then, we use the formula for combinations (n choose 2), which calculates the number of possible pairs that can be made from n items. We multiply this by 2, since each pair can collide in either direction. Finally, we return the total number of collisions.",
			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an input parameter `n` which represents the number of cars driving left to right and the number of cars driving right to left on an infinitely long straight road. The function calculates the number of collisions that occur when the two sets of cars meet each other.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for the total number of collisions which is `n*(n-1)/2`. This formula calculates the number of pairs of cars that can collide with each other.\n\nIn this case, we have two sets of `n` cars each, so the total number of collisions is `n*(n-1)` since each car in one set can collide with each car in the other set. However, we have counted each collision twice, once for each car involved in the collision. Therefore, we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of collisions.\n\nThe final implementation of the function is as follows:\n\n```\nfunction car_race_collision(n){\n  return n*(n-1)/2;\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes an input parameter `n` which represents the number of cars driving in each direction on an infinitely long straight road.

It initializes two arrays, `ltr_cars` and `rtl_cars`, which represent the positions of the cars on the road. The left-to-right cars are represented by positive numbers, and the right-to-left cars are represented by negative numbers. For example, if `n` is 3, the `ltr_cars` array might look like `[1, 2, 3]`, and the `rtl_cars` array might look like `[-1, -2, -3]`.\n\nThe function then simulates the movement of the cars by iterating over time steps. At each time step, it moves each car one unit to the right or left, depending on its direction. It then checks if any cars have collided by comparing the positions of the left-to-right cars and the right-to-left cars. If two cars have collided, the function increments a counter variable.\n\nThe function returns the total number of collisions that occurred during the simulation",

We initialize the positions of the left-moving cars to the integers `0` to `n-1`, and the positions of the right-moving cars to the integers `2n` to `3n-1`. This ensures that the two sets of cars start out very far from each other.\n\nWe then enter a loop that continues until either all the left-moving cars or all the right-moving cars have collided or reached the end of the road. In each iteration of the loop, we compare the position of the leftmost car with the position of the rightmost car. If the leftmost car is to the left of the rightmost car, we move the leftmost car to the right by one position. If the leftmost car is to the right of the rightmost car, we move the rightmost car to the left by one position. If the two cars have the same position, we count this as a collision and move both cars to the next position. We keep track of the number of collisions in a variable `collisions`.\n\nFinally, we return the total number of collisions that occurred during the race."

Then, it loops through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of n and checks if n is divisible by any of them. If it is, the function returns false since n is not prime. If it loops through all the numbers and doesn't find any that divide n, it means that n is prime, and the function returns true.\n\nNow, when we call the function with a number, it will return true if it is prime, and false otherwise. For example:\n\n```\nconsole.log(is_prime(6)); // false\nconsole.log(is_prime(101)); // true\nconsole.log(is_prime(11)); // true\nconsole.log(is_prime(13441)); // true\nconsole.log(is_prime(61)); // true\nconsole.log(is_prime(4)); // false\nconsole.log(is_prime(1)); // false\n``` \n\nThese calls will return the output as described in the prompt.",
			"The function `is_prime()` takes a number `n` as input and returns `true` if the number is a prime number, and `false` otherwise. Here's the code to implement the function:\n\n```\nfunction is_prime(n){\n  if (n <= 1){\n    return false;\n  }\n  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++){\n    if (n % i === 0){\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\nThe function first checks if the input number is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `false` because by definition, neither 1 nor any number less than 1 can be prime.\n\nNext, the function runs a loop starting from `2` up to the square root of the input number. It checks if the input number is divisible by the current loop index `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If the input number is divisible by `i`, the function returns `false` because it means that the input number is not prime.\n\nIf the loop completes without returning `false`, it means that the input number is prime, and the function returns `true`.\n\nFor example, if we call `is_prime(6)`, the function will return `false` because 6 is divisible by 2 and 3. But if we call `is_prime(101)`, the function will return `true` because 101 is only divisible by 1 and itself."
