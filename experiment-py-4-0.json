			"\n\nThe function `largest_divisor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`. \n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n```\n\nThe function starts iterating from `n-1` (which is the largest possible divisor smaller than `n`) down to `1`. For each integer `i` in this range, the function checks whether it is a divisor of `n` by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n % i` is equal to 0, then `i` is a divisor of `n`. In this case, the function returns `i` as the largest divisor of `n`.\n\nIf none of the integers in the range are divisors of `n`, the function will terminate without returning anything. In this case, the function will implicitly return `None`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the function:\n\n```python\n>>> largest_divisor(15)\n5\n>>> largest_divisor(21)\n7\n>>> largest_divisor(100)\n50\n``` \n\nIn this example, `largest_divisor(15)` returns `5` because `15` has divisors `1`, `3`, `5`, and `15`, and `5` is the largest divisor smaller than `15`.",
			"Sure, here's a function that should fulfill the prompt:\n\n```\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n    return 1\n```\n\nThis function starts by iterating through numbers from `n-1` down to 1. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` with no remainder. If it is, then `i` is the largest divisor of `n` smaller than `n`, so we return `i`. If we reach the end of the loop without finding a divisor, we return 1 as the largest divisor of `n`.",

For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` with zero remainder (i.e., if `n % i == 0`). If it is, then `i` is the largest number that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`, so the function returns `i`. If no such `i` is found, the function returns `None`.\n\nFor example, calling `largest_divisor(15)` will loop through the numbers `14, 13, 12, 11, ..., 2` in reverse order. The first number that divides `15` evenly is `5`, so the function returns `5`.",

It does this by iterating through all integers between `n-1` and `1` in reverse order, and checking if each integer is a divisor of `n`. The first divisor it finds will be the largest, since we are iterating in reverse order.\n\nFor example, if `n = 15`, the function will start by checking `14`, then `13`, and so on, until it finds a divisor of `n`. In this case, the largest divisor of `15` that is smaller than `15` is `5`, so the function will return `5`.",
			"\n\nThe function `largest_divisor(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest number that evenly divides `n` and is smaller than `n`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We start the loop from `n-1` and go till `1` (inclusive) because we want to find the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`.\n- In each iteration of the loop, we check if `i` evenly divides `n` using the modulo operator `%`. If it does, we return `i`.\n- If no divisor is found in the loop, the function returns `None` (which is the default return value if we don't explicitly return anything).\n\nLet's test the function:\n\n```python\n>>> largest_divisor(15)\n5\n>>> largest_divisor(21)\n7\n>>> largest_divisor(17)\n1\n``` \n\nAs expected, the function returns the largest divisor for each input.",

The function `largest_divisor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest number that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`.\n\n2. To find the largest divisor, we start iterating from `n-1` to `1` in reverse order. We do this because we want to find the largest divisor that divides `n` evenly, and the largest possible divisor would be `n-1`.\n\n3. For each number in the range, we check if it's a divisor of `n` by checking if `n` is divisible by it using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is a divisor, we return it as the largest divisor.\n\n4. If we iterate through the entire range and don't find a divisor, we return -1 as an indication that there is no divisor smaller than `n` that divides it evenly.\n\n5. The function uses type hints to indicate that it takes an integer as input and returns an integer. The `-> int` part of the function signature indicates that it returns an integer.",

It does this by iterating over the numbers from `n-1` down to `1`, and checking if each number divides `n` evenly using the modulo operator `%`. If a divisor is found, it is immediately returned. If no divisor is found, the function returns `1`, since every integer is divisible by `1`.\n\nFor example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will start iterating over the numbers from `14` down to `1`. When it reaches `5`, it will check if `15 % 5 == 0`, which is true, so it will return `5`.",

If no divisor is found in the range, the function returns `None`.\n\nFor example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will start iterating from `14` backwards, and it will find that `15` is divisible by `5`, so it will return `5`.",

We check if the current number is a divisor of n or not. If it is, we return that number as it would be the largest divisor that divides n evenly, smaller than n.\n\nFor example, let's call the function with an argument of 15:\n\n```\n>>> largest_divisor(15)\n5\n```\n\nHere, 5 is the largest number that divides 15 evenly and is smaller than 15.",

To do this, the function loops through all the integers between `n-1` and `1` (inclusive) in descending order using `range(n-1, 0, -1)`. For each integer `i` in this range, it checks whether `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`, so the function returns `i`.\n\nFor example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will start by looping through the integers between 14 and 1 (inclusive) in descending order. The first integer it checks is 14, but 15 is not divisible by 14, so it moves on to 13. Again, 15 is not divisible by 13, so it moves on to 12. This time, 15 is divisible by 12, so the function immediately returns 12 as the largest divisor of 15 that is smaller than 15.",

In this case, the input string is a valid algebraic expression, so `eval()` returns the correct result.\n\nNote: The use of `eval()` function can be dangerous if the input expression is not properly validated, as it allows arbitrary code execution.

The function returns an integer, which is the result of evaluating the algebraic expression.\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `result` with the value of the first operand in the list `operand`.

			"\n\nThe problem statement describes two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions with equal speed on an infinitely long straight road. We need to count the number of collisions that happen when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to note that if there are i cars moving left to right, then there are n-i cars moving right to left. If we sort the two sets of cars by their starting positions, then we can iterate over the left-to-right cars and count the number of collisions with the right-to-left cars.\n\nTo implement this algorithm, we can create two lists of tuples, each tuple representing a car's starting position and its direction (either -1 for right-to-left or +1 for left-to-right). We can then sort both lists by their starting positions, and iterate over the left-to-right cars. For each left-to-right car, we can use binary search to find the rightmost right-to-left car that it might collide with. We can then count the number of right-to-left cars between the left-to-right car and the rightmost candidate, and add that to the total number of collisions.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom bisect import bisect_right\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    cars_lr = [(i, 1) for i in range(n)]\n    cars_rl = [(i, -1) for i in range(n)]\n    cars = cars_lr + cars_rl\n    cars.sort()\n\n    collisions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if cars[i][1] == 1:\n            j = bisect_right(cars, (cars[i][0], -1))\n            collisions += j - i - 1\n\n    return collisions\n```\n\nWe start by creating two lists of tuples, `cars_lr` and `cars_rl`, representing the left-to-right and right-to-left cars, respectively. Each tuple contains the car's starting position and its direction, encoded as +1 or -1. We then concatenate the two lists into a single list `cars`, sort it by the starting positions, and iterate over the left-to-right cars.\n\nFor each left-to-right car, we use binary search to find the rightmost right-to-left car that it might collide with. This is done using the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which returns the index of the rightmost element in a sorted list that is less",
			"\n\nThe given prompt is asking to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. The function takes an integer 'n' as input and returns the number of collisions as an integer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can observe that each car moving in one direction will eventually meet a car moving in the opposite direction. This will happen exactly once for each car. Therefore, the total number of collisions will be equal to the number of cars 'n'.\n\nThe implementation of the function will be a simple return statement that returns the input integer 'n' as output. \n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of collisions between n cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.\n\n    Args:\n    n: An integer representing the number of cars moving in one direction.\n\n    Returns:\n    An integer representing the number of collisions between the cars.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer 'n' as input and returns it as output, representing the number of collisions between the cars.",
			"\n\nThe car_race_collision function takes an integer input n, which represents the number of cars traveling in each direction. The function simulates a scenario where two sets of cars are moving towards each other on an infinitely long straight road. Each set of cars has n cars, and all cars move at the same speed.\n\nThe function counts the number of collisions that happen between the cars moving towards each other. A collision happens when a car that is moving left to right hits a car that is moving right to left. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their respective trajectories without altering their paths.\n\nTo count the collisions, the function iterates over each pair of cars traveling towards each other and checks if they will collide. A collision occurs when the distance between the two cars is an integer multiple of their combined width, which is equal to 2. If a collision occurs, the function increments a counter variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total number of collisions that occurred during the simulation.\n\nHere's the implementation of the car_race_collision function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    collision_count = 0\n    car_width = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (j + i + 1) % car_width == 0:\n                collision_count += 1\n    return collision_count\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first initialize the collision_count variable to 0 and set the car_width to 2. Then, we use two nested loops to iterate over each pair of cars moving towards each other.\n\nTo check if a collision will occur between the i-th car traveling left to right and the j-th car traveling right to left, we add their indices together (i + j) and add 1. If this sum is divisible by the car_width, a collision will occur, and we increment the collision_count.\n\nFinally, we return the collision_count as the output of the function.",
			"\n\nThe prompt describes a scenario where two sets of cars are driving towards each other on an infinitely long straight road. The function should count the number of collisions that happen between the cars. \n\nTo solve the problem, we can start by noting that when two cars collide, they pass through each other and continue on their original paths without any change in direction. Therefore, we can think of each car as a point moving along a line, and we can track the positions of the cars as they move towards each other.\n\nThe function can take an input parameter `n` that represents the number of cars in each set. To represent the positions of the cars, we can use two arrays `left` and `right` of length `n`, where `left[i]` and `right[i]` represent the positions of the `i`-th car from the left-moving and right-moving sets, respectively. \n\nWe can initialize the arrays with random positions such that the cars are initially far apart from each other. Then, we can loop over a sequence of time steps, and at each time step, we update the positions of the cars by moving them forward by a fixed distance (which we can set to 1 for simplicity). \n\nTo count the number of collisions, we can loop over the cars and check if there is a collision between the `i`-th car from the left-moving set and the `j`-th car from the right-moving set. If there is a collision, we can increment a counter and continue to the next pair of cars. \n\nFinally, the function should return the total number of collisions that occurred during the simulation. Here's the code for the function:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    left = [random.randint(0, 1000) for _ in range(n)]\n    right = [random.randint(1001, 2000) for _ in range(n)]\n    collision_count = 0\n    \n    for time in range(1000):\n        for i in range(n):\n            left[i] += 1\n            right[i] -= 1\n            \n            if left[i] == right[i]:\n                collision_count += 1\n    \n    return collision_count\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we assume that each car moves forward by 1 unit of distance per time step, and we run the simulation for 1000 time steps. We also generate random initial positions for the cars to ensure that they start far apart from each other.",
			"\n\nThe prompt is asking to find the number of collisions that would happen between n cars driving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. Since the cars have the same speed, we can assume that they are moving at a constant velocity. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative velocity. When two cars are moving in opposite directions, their relative velocity is the sum of their individual velocities. Since the cars are moving with the same speed, their relative velocity is zero. This means that the distance between the cars will remain constant throughout their journey.\n\nWe can represent the position of the cars using an array. Let's assume that the left-to-right cars start from position 0 and the right-to-left cars start from position n. As the cars move, we can update their positions in the array. We can then compare the positions of the cars and count the number of collisions.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    ltr_cars = [i for i in range(n)]  # left-to-right cars start at position 0\n    rtl_cars = [i for i in range(n, 2*n)]  # right-to-left cars start at position n\n    collisions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if ltr_cars[i] == rtl_cars[i]:\n            collisions += 1\n    return collisions\n```\n\nThe function takes an integer n as input, which represents the number of cars. It initializes two arrays ltr_cars and rtl_cars, which represent the positions of the left-to-right and right-to-left cars respectively. We then iterate over the arrays and compare the positions of the cars. If the positions are the same, we increment the collisions counter. Finally, we return the total number of collisions.\n\nNote that the function assumes that there are no multiple collisions between the same pair of cars. If multiple collisions are possible, we would need to modify the function accordingly.",
			"\n\nThe given prompt is asking us to count the number of collisions that occur when n cars moving left to right intersect with n cars moving right to left on a straight road. We can start by creating two lists representing the positions of the left-to-right and right-to-left cars at any given time. Then, we can iterate through each car in the left-to-right list and check if there is a car in the opposite direction within the range of its position. If there is, we increment the collision counter and move on to the next car. After checking all cars moving left to right, we return the total number of collisions.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    left_cars = [i for i in range(1, n+1)]  # positions of cars moving left to right\n    right_cars = [i for i in range(n+1, 2*n+1)]  # positions of cars moving right to left\n    collisions = 0  # counter for number of collisions\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if left_cars[i] == right_cars[j]:  # check if two cars are at same position\n                collisions += 1\n    \n    return collisions\n```\n\nWe create two lists, `left_cars` and `right_cars`, to represent the positions of the cars. The `left_cars` list contains values from 1 to n, while the `right_cars` list contains values from n+1 to 2n. \n\nNext, we create a `collisions` variable initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of collisions. We iterate through each car in the `left_cars` list, and for each car, we iterate through all the cars in the `right_cars` list to check if there is a car at the same position. If there is, we increment the `collisions` counter.\n\nFinally, we return the total number of collisions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all cars are moving at the same speed and that their positions are continuous integers. If there are more complex scenarios involved, the implementation would need to be adjusted accordingly.",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we can imagine that the left-moving cars are stationary, and the right-moving cars are moving with double the speed. In this scenario, we can count the number of collisions as the number of right-moving cars that pass a left-moving car. \n\nLet's say there are `n` cars moving in each direction. The right-moving cars will reach the left-most car after `n` time units. At this point, the left-most car will have been passed by `n-1` cars. Similarly, the second left-most car will be passed by `n-2` cars, and so on. Thus, the total number of collisions will be the sum of these counts, which is `1+2+...+(n-1) = n*(n-1)/2`.\n\nWith this understanding, we can write the function as follows:\n\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return (n * (n-1)) // 2\n```\n\nHere, we are using integer division `//` to ensure that the output is an integer. \n\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```python\n>>> car_race_collision(5)\n10\n```\n\nThis means that with 5 cars moving in each direction, there will be a total of 10 collisions.",
			"\n\nThe prompt is asking us to count the number of collisions between n cars driving in opposite directions on a straight road. As given in the prompt, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so we don't need to worry about them stopping or changing direction after a collision.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. Each car in the left-to-right set can collide with any car in the right-to-left set, except for the cars that are directly opposite to it. Since there are n cars in each set, there are n*(n-1) possible collisions per car in the left-to-right set. Therefore, the total number of collisions is n*(n-1)*n = n^2*(n-1).\n\nWe can write a function `car_race_collision` to implement this logic as follows:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of collisions between n cars driving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.\n    \"\"\"\n    return n**2*(n-1)\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars in each set. It returns an integer representing the total number of collisions. We calculate the number of collisions using the formula n^2*(n-1) and return the result.",

The number of cars moving in the opposite direction would also be `n`. The function would return the total number of collisions that occur.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to realize that a car collision can only occur when a car moving from left to right intersects with a car moving from right to left. The cars' speed and direction of movement do not matter as long as they intersect.\n\nSuppose we have `n` cars moving in each direction. The first car moving from left to right would collide with the `n`th car moving from right to left. Similarly, the second car moving from left to right would collide with the `n-1`th car moving from right to left, and so on. Hence, the total number of collisions that could occur is `n`.\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the function would be as follows:\n\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n\n```\n\nThis function simply returns the number of cars moving in one direction as the number of collisions that could occur.",

The function needs to count the number of collisions that occur when a left-moving car collides with a right-moving car. The cars are infinitely sturdy, so they don't stop or change course when they collide. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can think of each car as a point moving along a line. We can represent the position of each car by its distance from a fixed point on the line, and the direction of each car by a boolean flag indicating whether it's moving left or right. If we sort the positions of all cars in ascending order, we can compare each left-moving car with each right-moving car to find collisions.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize positions and directions of all cars\n    positions = [random.uniform(0, 1) for _ in range(2*n)]\n    directions = [bool(random.getrandbits(1)) for _ in range(2*n)]\n    # Sort positions in ascending order\n    positions.sort()\n    # Count collisions\n    collisions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if directions[i] != directions[n+i] and positions[i] < positions[n+i]:\n            collisions += 1\n    return collisions\n```\n\nThe function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars in each set. It returns an integer, which is the number of collisions that occur.\n\nIn the first two lines, we initialize the positions and directions of all cars using random values. The `random.uniform` function generates a random float between 0 and 1, and the `random.getrandbits` function generates a random boolean flag. We need to generate positions and directions for both sets of cars, so we create two lists of length 2n.\n\nWe then sort the positions of all cars in ascending order using the `sort` method of the `list` class.\n\nNext, we iterate over the first n positions, comparing each left-moving car with each right-moving car. If the two cars are moving in opposite directions and the left-moving car is to the left of the right-moving car, we count a collision.

Each car moving in one direction can collide with any car moving in the opposite direction, except for itself. Hence, the total number of collisions is equal to the number of ways to choose two cars from n cars, which is given by the formula n * (n - 1) / 2. \n\nFor example, if n is 3, there are three cars moving left to right and three cars moving right to left. The six cars can be paired in 3*3=9 ways, but we need to remove the cases where a car collides with itself (which is not possible), so the actual number of collisions is 9-3=6. The function correctly returns 6 for this case.",

We will move the cars one position at a time until all left-moving cars have passed all right-moving cars.\n\nAt each step, we will check if there is any collision between the cars.

We know that each left-moving car can potentially collide with all right-moving cars, and vice versa. So, the total number of possible collisions would be the product of the number of left-moving cars and the number of right-moving cars.\n\nHowever, we also know that each collision would be counted twice in this calculation because both the left-moving car and the right-moving car would be counted as separate entities. To account for this, we can divide the total number of possible collisions by 2.\n\nThe implementation of this logic in Python would look something like this:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    total_cars = 2*n\n    total_collisions = (total_cars * (total_cars - 1)) / 2  # using combinatorics to calculate total collisions\n    return int(total_collisions)\n```\n\nHere, we first calculate the total number of cars as 2n since there are n left-moving cars and n right-moving cars. Then, we use the combinatorics formula to calculate the total number of possible collisions. Finally, we return the integer value of this result.",
			"\n\nTo solve this problem, we can create two lists of n random integers, representing the positions of the cars moving left to right and right to left on the infinitely long line. We can then sort both lists and compare the positions of the cars moving in opposite directions. Whenever the position of a car moving left to right is greater than the position of a car moving right to left, a collision occurs. We can count the number of collisions and return it as the output of the function.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    left_to_right = sorted([random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(n)])\n    right_to_left = sorted([random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(n)])\n    collisions = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if left_to_right[i] > right_to_left[i]:\n            collisions += 1\n    return collisions\n```\n\nWe first import the `random` module to generate random positions for the cars. We then create the two lists of positions using list comprehension and sort them. We initialize a `collisions` variable to 0 and iterate over the positions of the cars using a `for` loop. Whenever we find a collision, we increment the `collisions` counter. Finally, we return the total number of collisions as the output of the function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the speed of all cars is the same, and the positions are random. Also, this function does not return the positions of the cars involved in collisions, just the total number of collisions.",
			"\n\nThe given prompt requires us to count the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. We can assume that the cars are moving at the same speed, and they will continue moving after the collision.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible collisions between the two sets of cars. If we have n cars moving in each direction, then there are n*n possible collisions, as each car in one set can collide with each car in the other set.\n\nHowever, we can optimize the solution by realizing that the collisions will only happen when the cars are directly opposite to each other. That is, the first car in the left-to-right set will only collide with the first car in the right-to-left set, the second car in the left-to-right set will only collide with the second car in the right-to-left set, and so on.\n\nTherefore, we can count the number of collisions by simply iterating through the cars in each set and checking if they are directly opposite to each other. If they are, then we increment the collision counter.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # initialize collision counter\n    collisions = 0\n    \n    # iterate through the cars in each set\n    for i in range(n):\n        # check if the cars are directly opposite to each other\n        if (i+1)*2 <= n:\n            collisions += 1\n            \n    # return the number of collisions\n    return collisions\n```\n\nIn the above implementation, we use the formula `(i+1)*2` to check if the cars are directly opposite to each other. This formula works because each car is moving at the same speed, so the time it takes for the first car in the left-to-right set to meet the first car in the right-to-left set is the same as the time it takes for the second car in the left-to-right set to meet the second car in the right-to-left set, and so on. Therefore, if `(i+1)*2` is less than or equal to `n`, then the cars are directly opposite to each other and a collision will occur.",
			"\n\nThe given prompt requires us to count the number of collisions that occur when n cars moving left to right intersect n cars moving right to left on a straight infinitely long road. The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions that occur.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n * (n - 1)\n```\n\nThe logic behind the function is that for every car moving left to right, there are n cars moving right to left that it can potentially collide with. Therefore, the total number of collisions is simply the product of n and (n-1). We subtract 1 from n because a car cannot collide with itself.\n\nFor example, if n is 3, there are three cars moving left to right and three cars moving right to left. The first car moving left to right can collide with any of the three cars moving right to left. Similarly, the second car moving left to right can also collide with any of the three cars moving right to left. However, the third car moving left to right can only collide with two cars moving right to left (since it has already collided with one of the right-to-left cars). Thus, the total number of collisions is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all cars move at the same speed and that there are no other obstacles on the road that could affect the collisions.",
			"\n\nThe given prompt requires us to find the number of collisions that occur between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. The function takes an integer value n as input, representing the number of cars in each set. \n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    # The number of possible collisions is the same as the number of pairs of cars from different sets.\n    # So, we just need to calculate the number of pairs from the two sets of cars.\n    # The formula for the number of pairs is n*(n-1)/2.\n    num_pairs = n * (n-1) // 2\n    return num_pairs\n```\n\nThe function starts by calculating the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since we have n cars in each set, the number of pairs is n*(n-1)/2. This formula simply calculates the number of ways we can choose two cars from n cars. The // operator is used for integer division in Python.\n\nFinally, the function returns the number of pairs, which is the number of collisions that will occur. \n\nNote that the function assumes that all cars move at the same speed and that collisions do not affect the trajectory of the cars.",
			"\n\nThe given prompt requires us to simulate a scenario where n cars are moving left to right and simultaneously, a different set of n cars are moving right to left. We need to find out the number of collisions between the cars moving in opposite directions. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can create two arrays, one for the left-moving cars and the other for the right-moving cars. We can then sort both arrays, as it will help us find the cars that are closest to each other. We can then iterate over both arrays simultaneously and check if there is a collision. If a collision occurs, we increment the counter and move to the next set of cars.\n\nHere's the function that implements this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]\n    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]\n    collisions = 0\n    \n    left_cars.sort()\n    right_cars.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if left_cars[i] >= right_cars[i]:\n            collisions += 1\n    \n    return collisions\n```\n\nWe start by creating two arrays of size n, one for the left-moving cars and the other for the right-moving cars. We then sort both arrays using the `sort()` method. The left-moving cars array is sorted in ascending order and the right-moving cars array is sorted in descending order.\n\nWe then iterate over both arrays simultaneously using a for loop. We compare the positions of the left-moving car and the right-moving car at the same index. If the position of the left-moving car is greater than or equal to the position of the right-moving car, a collision occurs, and we increment the counter.\n\nFinally, we return the number of collisions that occurred during the simulation.\n\nFor example, `car_race_collision(3)` would return 3, as all three left-moving cars would collide with the three right-moving cars.",
			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n: int) -> int` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer representing the number of collisions that happen between cars moving in opposite directions.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can imagine a point where the two sets of cars meet, which we can call the collision point. Since all cars move at the same speed, the collision point will be reached at the same time by all cars. Therefore, we only need to consider the cars to the left of the collision point and the cars to the right of the collision point separately.\n\nFor each car to the left of the collision point, we need to determine how many cars to the right of the collision point it will collide with. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, we can assume that a car will collide with all the cars to its right.\n\nTherefore, the total number of collisions will be the sum of collisions for all cars to the left of the collision point, which is `n*(n-1)/2`. This is because each car will collide with `n-1` other cars, but we need to divide by 2 since each collision will be counted twice (once for each car involved in the collision).\n\nThe implementation of the function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n*(n-1)//2\n```\n\nThe `//` operator is used instead of `/` to perform integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer.",
			"\n\nThe function `car_race_collision(n: int) -> int` takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions that occur between two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can observe that each car moving in one direction will collide with exactly one car moving in the opposite direction. Therefore, the number of collisions will be equal to the number of cars in one direction multiplied by the number of cars in the opposite direction.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented as n * n, which simplifies to n^2.\n\nThus, the implementation of the function can be as simple as:\n\n```\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    return n ** 2\n```\n\nThis function simply returns the square of the input integer n, which represents the number of collisions between the two sets of cars."

Therefore, it is sufficient to check if n is divisible by any number up to the square root of n.",
			"\n\nThe function `is_prime` takes an integer `n` as an input and returns a boolean value `True` if the given input `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.\n\nTo determine if an integer is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we will loop through all integers from 2 to the square root of `n` and check if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any of the integers within this range, then it is not a prime number.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `is_prime` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    \n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n```\n\nWe first check if the input `n` is less than 2, in which case it cannot be a prime number. Then, we loop through all integers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) using `range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)`. We use the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of `n` and convert it to an integer using the `int` function. We add 1 to the result since the `range` function is exclusive of the end value.\n\nFor each integer within this range, we check if `n` is divisible by it using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, we immediately return `False` since `n` is not a prime number. If we get through the entire loop without finding any divisors, then `n` is a prime number, and we return `True`.\n\nWe can run some test cases to verify that the function works correctly:\n\n```python\nprint(is_prime(6))     # False\nprint(is_prime(101))   # True\nprint(is_prime(11))    # True\nprint(is_prime(13441)) # True\nprint(is_prime(61))    # True\nprint(is_prime(4))     # False\nprint(is_prime(1))     # False\n```",

Since 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, the function returns `False`. When we call `is_prime(101)`, the function checks if 101 is divisible by any number from 2 to 11 (since `int(101**0.5) + 1 = 11`).

It does this using a for loop that iterates over the range from 2 to `int(n**0.5)+1` (inclusive). \n\nIf `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it means it is not prime, so the function returns False.\n\nIf the function completes the for loop without finding any factors of `n`, it means that the input `n` is not divisible by any number up to its square root, so it is prime.

If `n` is 2, the function returns `True` because it's the smallest prime number.\n\nIf `n` is not 2 and is an even number, then the function returns `False` because all even numbers (except for 2) are not prime. Otherwise, the function uses a loop to check if `n` is divisible by any odd number from 3 up to the square root of `n` (inclusive).

For each `num`, it checks whether it contains any even digit. If it does, it skips to the next `num`. If it doesn't, it adds it to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list sorted in increasing order.\n\nTo check whether a number contains any even digit, the function converts it to a string and loops through each character (digit) in the string. It checks whether the integer value of the digit is divisible by 2 (i.e., even).

It then loops through each number in the input list `x`.\n\nFor each number, it checks whether it has an even digit by converting the number to a string and iterating over its digits. If any digit is even, the variable `has_even_digit` is set to True and the inner loop is broken.

To accomplish this, we iterate through each element in `x` and convert it to a list of its digits using the `str` and `int` functions. We then use a list comprehension to filter out all even digits, and we use the `all` function to check if all digits in the resulting list are odd. If so, we append the original number to a `result` list. Finally, we return the `result` list sorted in increasing order.\n\nFor example, `unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])` would first convert `15` to `[1, 5]`, then filter out `2` from `[1, 4, 2, 2]`, and check that `[1, 5]` only contains odd digits.

The function performs the XOR operation on these two strings and returns the result as a binary string.\n\nTo perform the XOR operation, we iterate through each character of the two input strings and compare them. If the characters are the same, then we add a 0 to the result string, otherwise we add a 1. After iterating through all the characters, the result string is returned.\n\nFor example, if we call the function with inputs '010' and '110', the function will iterate through each character of the two input strings as follows:\n\n```\na = '010'\nb = '110'\nresult = ''\n\ni = 0\na[i] = '0'\nb[i] = '1'\nresult += '1'  # since '0' XOR '1' = '1'\n\ni = 1\na[i] = '1'\nb[i] = '1'\nresult += '0'  # since '1' XOR '1' = '0'\n\ni = 2\na[i] = '0'\nb[i] = '0'\nresult += '0'  # since '0' XOR '0' = '0'\n\nresult = '100'\n```\n\nFinally, the function returns the result string '100', which is the binary XOR of the two input strings '010' and '110'.",

Otherwise, it appends `'0'` to `result`. Finally, the function returns `result`.\n\nIn the given example, the inputs are `'010'` and `'110'`.

This gives us two integers that we can perform bitwise operations on.\n\nWe then perform the XOR operation using the `^` operator, which performs a bitwise XOR on the two integers.\n\nFinally, we convert the result back to a binary string using the `bin()` function and slice off the first two characters (which are the characters '0b' representing the binary notation).\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\n>>> string_xor('010', '110')\n'100'\n```\n\nIn this example, the function takes the binary strings `'010'` and `'110'` as inputs and performs the XOR operation on them.

The function performs binary XOR operation on these inputs by comparing each bit of `a` and `b`, and adding 1 to the result string if the bits are different, otherwise adding 0. The result of the XOR operation is returned as a string.\n\nIn the implementation, we first initialize an empty string `result` to store the XOR result. We then iterate through the bits of `a` and `b` using a for loop with the `range` function. Inside the loop, we compare the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` at the current index `i` using the `!=` operator. If the bits are different, we add 1 to the `result` string using the `+=` operator. Otherwise, we add 0. Finally, we return the `result` string as the output of the function.\n\nFor example, the function call `string_xor('010', '110')` will return the string `'100'`, which is the binary XOR of `'010'` and `'110'`.",

The function first converts the input strings to integer values using the `int()` function and specifying a base of 2 (binary). It then performs the binary XOR operation on these integer values using the bitwise operator `^`.

If the digits are the same, the result digit is set to `0`, otherwise, it is set to `1`.\n\nFor example, if `a` is `010` and `b` is `110`, we compare the digits at each position: `0 XOR 1` gives `1`, `1 XOR 1` gives `0`, and `0 XOR 0` gives `0`. Therefore, the result of the XOR operation is `100`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result string, which is `'100'` in this example.\n\nThe function also includes a docstring with an example usage of the function and the expected output.",

It then performs a binary XOR operation on these inputs and returns the result as a string.\n\nThe function works by iterating through the characters in both `a` and `b` using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if the corresponding character in the other string is the same. If it is, it adds a 0 to the result string.

			"\n\nThe function `string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str` takes in two string arguments `a` and `b`. These two strings contain only 1s and 0s, and will be used to perform a binary XOR operation.\n\nThe function then applies the XOR operation on `a` and `b` by comparing each corresponding bit of the two strings, and returns the result as a new string.\n\nHere's the code implementation for the function:\n\n```python\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if a[i] == b[i]:\n            result += '0'\n        else:\n            result += '1'\n    return result\n```\n\nThe above code uses a `for` loop to iterate through each corresponding bit of the two input strings. If the bits at the same position in the strings are the same, the corresponding bit in the result string will be `0`. Otherwise, it will be `1`.\n\nFor example, if we call the function with `string_xor('010', '110')`, it will return `'100'`, which is the result of performing the XOR operation on these two input strings.\n\nNote that the function assumes that the two input strings are of the same length.

The function performs a binary XOR (exclusive OR) operation on these inputs and returns the result as a string.\n\nThe binary XOR operation works by comparing the corresponding bits in each input and returning a 1 if the bits are different, and a 0 if they are the same. For example, if `a` is `'010'` and `b` is `'110'`, the function would perform the following operation:\n\n    010\n  XOR 110\n  -----\n    100\n\nThe result of this operation is `'100'`, which the function would return.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `string_xor` function:\n\n```\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    result = ''\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if a[i] != b[i]:\n            result += '1'\n        else:\n            result += '0'\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function starts by initializing an empty string `result`, which will store the result of the binary XOR operation. It then iterates over the indices of `a` using a `for` loop.\n\nFor each index `i`, the function checks if the bit at that index in `a` is different from the bit at the same index in `b`. If they are different, the function appends a `'1'` to `result`. Otherwise, it appends a `'0'`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the result string.",

We pass the optional `base` argument to `int` to indicate that the input strings are in binary format.\n\nNext, we perform the XOR operation using the bitwise XOR operator `^`. This returns an integer value that is also in binary format.\n\nWe then convert this integer value back into a binary string using the built-in `bin` function. The `bin` function returns a string that starts with the prefix `'0b'`, so we slice off the first two characters to get the binary string without the prefix.\n\nFinally, we pad the binary result with zeros if necessary to ensure that it has the same length as the input strings. We return the result as a string.",

It performs the binary XOR operation on these inputs by comparing the digits at each position of the strings.

If the digits are different (one 0 and one 1), the function adds a '1' to the `result` string. \n\nThe function then returns the `result` string as the output of the function. \n\nFor example, if we call `string_xor('010', '110')`, the function will compare the digits at each position and add a '1' for the first position (0 in '010' XOR 1 in '110'), a '0' for the second position (1 in '010' XOR 1 in '110'), and a '0' for the third position (0 in '010' XOR 0 in '110').
