Each right-moving car can potentially collide with any of the left-moving cars, so there are `n` possible collisions for each right-moving car. Since there are `n` right-moving cars, the total number of collisions is `n * n`, but we've double-counted each collision (once from the perspective of the right-moving car, and once from the perspective of the left-moving car), so we need to divide by 2.

If it is, we return `False`.\n\nNext, we get the last character of the input string by using the indexing operator and passing `-1` as the index.\n\nFinally, we check if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not a part of a word. We do this by using the `isalpha()` method to check if the last character is an alphabetical character, and the `split()` method to split the input string into words and get the last word. We then check if the length of the last word is 1 (i.e., it contains only the last character).\n\nIf the last character is an alphabetical character and is not a part of a word, we return `True`.

The function takes a string `txt` as input and returns a boolean value.\n2. If the input string is empty or contains only whitespaces, the function returns False.\n3. The `strip()` method is used to remove any whitespaces at the beginning or end of the string.\n4. The last character of the string is retrieved using `txt[-1]`.\n5.
