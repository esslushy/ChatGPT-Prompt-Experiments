			"Here is the implementation of the `largest_divisor` function:\n\n```python\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n\n    \"\"\"\n    largest = 1\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            largest = i\n    return largest\n```\n\nThe function starts by initializing a variable `largest` to 1, which is the smallest possible divisor of any number. Then it loops through all the numbers between 2 and `n-1`. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, then `i` is a divisor of `n`, and the function updates `largest` to be `i`, since we want to find the largest divisor. Finally, the function returns the value of `largest`.\n\nFor example, `largest_divisor(15)` will first check if 2 divides 15, which it doesn't. It will then check if 3 divides 15, which it does, so `largest` is updated to 3. It will then check if 4 divides 15, which it doesn't. It will continue in this way until it checks if 5 divides 15, which it does, and `largest` is updated to 5. Since there are no more numbers to check, the function returns 5, which is the largest divisor of 15.",
