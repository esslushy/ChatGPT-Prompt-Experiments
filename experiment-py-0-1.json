We then simulate the movement of the cars by shifting the integers in the set, and check for collisions by comparing the positions of left-to-right cars with the opposite of right-to-left cars. The function returns the number of collisions that occur before all cars pass each other.",

For each character, the function checks if the corresponding character in the other input string is the same or different. If they are the same, the function appends a `'0'` to the `result` string, otherwise it appends a `'1'`. Finally, the function returns the `result` string.",

It initializes an empty string `result` to store the result of the XOR operation. It then loops through each character in `a` and compares it to the corresponding character in `b`. If they are the same, it appends a \"0\" to `result`, otherwise it appends a \"1\". Finally, it returns the resulting string `result`.",
