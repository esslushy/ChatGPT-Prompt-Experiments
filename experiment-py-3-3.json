This may not be a valid assumption in all cases, but it should be sufficient for the purposes of this prompt. If you want to make the function more robust, you could add checks to make sure that `n` is positive and that the two groups of cars are actually moving towards each other.",

This is because each car going left to right can collide with each car going right to left, except for itself. So there are `n - 1` possible collisions for each car going left to right, and there are `n` cars going left to right, so the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1)`.",

It calculates the distance between two cars and then loops through all the cars moving left to right and all the cars moving right to left. For each pair of cars, it calculates their positions and checks if they collide. If they do, the collision count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total number of collisions.",

We first check if the input string is empty. If it is, we immediately return False since there is no last character to check.\n\n2. We strip any whitespace at the end of the string using the `rstrip` method. This is necessary to ensure that the last character we check is not a space.\n\n3. We split the string into words using the `split` method. This gives us a list of strings, where each string is a word in the input string.\n\n4. We get the last word in the list using indexing. If the list is empty (i.e. the input string contains no words), we set `last_word` to an empty string.\n\n5. We check if the last character of `last_word` is a letter using the `isalpha` method. We also check if the rest of `last_word` (i.e. all characters except the last one) is not a letter using the `isalpha` method. This ensures that the last character is a standalone letter and not part of a larger word.\n\n6. We return True if the above conditions are met, and False otherwise.",
